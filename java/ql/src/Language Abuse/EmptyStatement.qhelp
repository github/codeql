<overview>
<p>An <em>empty statement</em> is a single semicolon <code>;</code> that does not
terminate another statement. Such a statement hinders readability and has no effect on its own.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Avoid empty statements. If a loop is intended to have an empty body, it is better
to mark that fact explicitly by using a pair of braces <code>{}</code> containing an explanatory comment
for the body, rather than a single semicolon.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In the following example, there is an empty statement on line 3, where an additional semicolon is
used. On line 6, the <code>for</code> statement has an empty body because the condition is
immediately followed by a semicolon. In this case, it is better to include a pair of braces <code>{}</code> containing
an explanatory comment for the body instead.
