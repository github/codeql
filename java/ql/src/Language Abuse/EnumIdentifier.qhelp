<overview>
<p>Enumerations, or enums, were introduced in Java 5, with the keyword
<code>enum</code>. Code written before this may use <code>enum</code> as
an identifier. To compile such code, you must compile it with a command
such as <code>javac -source 1.4 ...</code>. However, this means that you 
cannot use any new features that are provided in Java 5 and later.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>To make it easier to compile the code and add code that uses new Java features,
rename any identifiers that are named <code>enum</code> in legacy code.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In the following example, <code>enum</code> is used as the name of a variable. This means that the
code does not compile unless the compiler's source language is set to 1.4 or earlier. To avoid this
constraint, the variable should be renamed.</p>
