* The query "`TrustManager` that accepts all certificates" (`java/insecure-trustmanager`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. Its results will now appear by default. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @intrigus-lgtm](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4879).
