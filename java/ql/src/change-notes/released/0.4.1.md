## 0.4.1

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `java/android/webview-debugging-enabled`, to detect instances of WebView debugging being enabled in production builds.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The alert message of many queries have been changed to better follow the style guide and make the message consistent with other languages.
* `PathSanitizer.qll` has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. This sanitizer was originally [submitted as part of an experimental query by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/7286).
* The queries `java/path-injection`, `java/path-injection-local` and `java/zipslip` now use the sanitizers provided by `PathSanitizer.qll`.
