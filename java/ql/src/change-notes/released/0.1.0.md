## 0.1.0

### Query Metadata Changes

* Added the `security-severity` tag to several queries.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed "Local information disclosure in a temporary directory" (`java/local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure`) to resolve false-negatives when OS isn't properly used as logical guard.
* The `SwitchCase.getRuleExpression()` predicate now gets expressions for case rules with an expression on the right-hand side of the arrow belonging to both `SwitchStmt` and `SwitchExpr`, and the corresponding `getRuleStatement()` no longer returns an `ExprStmt` in either case. Previously `SwitchStmt` and `SwitchExpr` behaved differently in 
this respect.
