## 0.4.2

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `java/android/incomplete-provider-permissions`, to detect if an Android ContentProvider is not protected with a correct set of permissions.
* A new query "Uncontrolled data used in content resolution" (`java/androd/unsafe-content-uri-resolution`) has been added. This query finds paths from user-provided data to URI resolution operations in Android's `ContentResolver` without previous validation or sanitization.
