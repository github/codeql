## 1.1.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* The query `java/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` no longer alerts about `RSA/ECB` algorithm strings.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `java/tainted-permissions-check` now uses threat models. This means that `local` sources are no longer included by default for this query, but can be added by enabling the `local` threat model.
* Added more `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils`-related sinks to the path injection query.
