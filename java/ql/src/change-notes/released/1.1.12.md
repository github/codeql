## 1.1.12

### Bug Fixes

* Classes that define a `writeReplace` method are no longer flagged by the `java/missing-no-arg-constructor-on-serializable` query on the assumption they are unlikely to be deserialized using the default algorithm.
* The query "Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm" (`java/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`) now gives the reason why the cryptographic algorithm is considered weak.
