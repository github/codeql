## 0.8.10

### New Queries

* Added a new query `java/android/insecure-local-key-gen` for finding instances of keys generated for biometric authentication in an insecure way.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* To reduce the number of false positives in the query "Insertion of sensitive information into log files" (`java/sensitive-log`), variables with names that contain "null" (case-insensitively) are no longer considered sources of sensitive information.
