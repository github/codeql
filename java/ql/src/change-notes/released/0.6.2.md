## 0.6.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `java/groovy-injection` now recognizes `groovy.text.TemplateEngine.createTemplate` as a sink.
* The queries `java/xxe` and `java/xxe-local` now recognize the second argument of calls to `XPath.evaluate` as a sink.
* Experimental sinks for the query "Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data" (`java/xxe`) have been promoted to the main query pack. These sinks were originally [submitted as part of an experimental query by @haby0](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/6564).
