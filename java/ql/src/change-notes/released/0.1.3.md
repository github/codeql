## 0.1.3

### New Queries

* Two new queries "Inefficient regular expression" (`java/redos`) and "Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data" (`java/polynomial-redos`) have been added.
These queries help find instances of Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerabilities. 

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Query `java/sensitive-log` has received several improvements.
  * It no longer considers usernames as sensitive information.
  * The conditions to consider a variable a constant (and therefore exclude it as user-provided sensitive information) have been tightened.
  * A sanitizer has been added to handle certain elements introduced by a Kotlin compiler plugin that have deceptive names.
