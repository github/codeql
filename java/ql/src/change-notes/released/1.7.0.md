## 1.7.0

### New Queries

* The query `java/insecure-spring-actuator-config` has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack as `java/spring-boot-exposed-actuators-config`. Its results will now appear by default. This query detects exposure of Spring Boot actuators through configuration files. It was originally submitted as an experimental query [by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/5384).

### Query Metadata Changes

* The tag `maintainability` has been removed from `java/run-finalizers-on-exit` and the tags `quality`, `correctness`, and `performance` have been added.
* The tag `maintainability` has been removed from `java/garbage-collection` and the tags `quality` and `correctness` have been added.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a bug that was causing false negatives in rare cases in the query `java/dereferenced-value-may-be-null`.
* Removed the `java/empty-statement` query that was subsumed by the `java/empty-block` query.
