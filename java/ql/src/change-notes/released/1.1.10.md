## 1.1.10

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added SHA-384 to the list of secure hashing algorithms. As a result the `java/potentially-weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query should no longer flag up uses of SHA-384.
* Added SHA3 to the list of secure hashing algorithms. As a result the `java/potentially-weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query should no longer flag up uses of SHA3.
* The `java/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query has been updated to no longer report uses of hash functions such as `MD5` and `SHA1` even if they are known to be weak. These hash algorithms are used very often in non-sensitive contexts, making the query too imprecise in practice. The `java/potentially-weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query has been updated to report these uses instead.
