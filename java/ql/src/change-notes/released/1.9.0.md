## 1.9.0

### New Queries

* The `java/sensitive-cookie-not-httponly` query has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack.
* Added a new query, `java/escaping`, to detect values escaping from classes marked as `@ThreadSafe`.
* Added a new query, `java/not-threadsafe`, to detect data races in classes marked as `@ThreadSafe`.
* Added a new query, `java/safe-publication`, to detect unsafe publication in classes marked as `@ThreadSafe`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Calls to `String.matches` are now treated as sanitizers for the `java/ssrf` query.
