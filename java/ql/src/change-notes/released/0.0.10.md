## 0.0.10

### Breaking Changes

* Add more classes to Netty request/response splitting. Change identification to `java/netty-http-request-or-response-splitting`.
  Identify request splitting differently from response splitting in query results.
  Support additional classes:
  * `io.netty.handler.codec.http.CombinedHttpHeaders`
  * `io.netty.handler.codec.http.DefaultHttpRequest`
  * `io.netty.handler.codec.http.DefaultFullHttpRequest`

### New Queries

* A new query titled "Local information disclosure in a temporary directory" (`java/local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure`) has been added.
  This query finds uses of APIs that leak potentially sensitive information to other local users via the system temporary directory.
  This query was originally [submitted as query by @JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/4388).
