## 1.8.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* The implementation of `java/dereferenced-value-may-be-null` has been completely replaced with a new general control-flow reachability library. This improves precision by reducing false positives. However, since the entire calculation has been reworked, there can be small corner cases where precision regressions might occur and new false positives may occur, but these cases should be rare.

### Bug Fixes

* The message for `java/diagnostic/database-quality` has been updated to include detailed database health metrics. Additionally, the threshold for reporting database health issues has been lowered from 95% to 85% (if any metric falls below this percentage). These changes are visible on the tool status page.
