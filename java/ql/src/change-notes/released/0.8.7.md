## 0.8.7

### New Queries

* Added the `java/exec-tainted-environment` query, to detect the injection of environment variables names or values from remote input.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* A manual neutral summary model for a callable now blocks all generated summary models for that callable from having any effect.
