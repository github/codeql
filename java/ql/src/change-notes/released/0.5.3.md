## 0.5.3

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `java/xxe-local`, which is a version of the XXE query that uses local sources (for example, reads from a local file).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `java/index-out-of-bounds` query has improved its handling of arrays of constant length, and may report additional results in those cases.
