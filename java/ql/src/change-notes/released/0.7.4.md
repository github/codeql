## 0.7.4

### New Queries

* Added the `java/trust-boundary-violation` query to detect trust boundary violations between HTTP requests and the HTTP session. Also added the `trust-boundary-violation` sink kind for sinks which may cross a trust boundary, such as calls to the `HttpSession#setAttribute` method.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The queries "Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data" (`java/xxe`) and "Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data from local source" (`java/xxe-local`) now recognize sinks in the MDHT library.
