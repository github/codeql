## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

* Contextual queries and the query libraries they depend on have been moved to the `codeql/java-all` package.

### New Queries

* A new query "Improper verification of intent by broadcast receiver" (`java/improper-intent-verification`) has been added. 
  This query finds instances of Android `BroadcastReceiver`s that don't verify the action string of received intents when registered
  to receive system intents.
