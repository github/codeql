## 0.0.12

### New Queries

* The query "Insertion of sensitive information into log files" (`java/sensitive-logging`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/3090).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

 * Updated "Local information disclosure in a temporary directory" (`java/local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure`) to remove false-positives when OS is properly used as logical guard.
