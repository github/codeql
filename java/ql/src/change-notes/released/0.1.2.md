## 0.1.2

### Query Metadata Changes

* Query `java/predictable-seed` now has a tag for CWE-337. 

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Query `java/insecure-cookie` now tolerates setting a cookie's secure flag to `request.isSecure()`. This means servlets that intentionally accept unencrypted connections will no longer raise an alert.
* The query `java/non-https-urls` has been simplified
and no longer requires its sinks to be `MethodAccess`es.
* The logic to detect `WebView`s with JavaScript (and optionally file access) enabled in the query `java/android/unsafe-android-webview-fetch` has been improved.
