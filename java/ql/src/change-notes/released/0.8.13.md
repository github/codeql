## 0.8.13

### New Queries

* The query `java/unsafe-url-forward-dispatch-load` has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack as `java/unvalidated-url-forward`. Its results will now appear by default. This query was originally submitted as an experimental query [by @haby0](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/6240) and [by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/7286).

### Major Analysis Improvements

* The `java/missing-case-in-switch` query now gives only a single alert for each switch statement, giving some examples of the missing cases as well as a count of how many are missing.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Variables named `tokenImage` are no longer sources for  the `java/sensitive-log` query. This is because this variable name is used in parsing code generated by JavaCC, so it causes a large number of false positive alerts.
* Added sanitizers for relative URLs, `List.contains()`, and checking the host of a URI to the `java/ssrf` and `java/unvalidated-url-redirection` queries.
