* The Java extractor now populates the `Method` relating to a `MethodAccess` consistently for calls using an explicit and implicit `this` qualifier. Previously if the method `foo` was inherited from a specialised generic type `ParentType<String>`, then an explicit call `this.foo()` would yield a `MethodAccess` whose `getMethod()` accessor returned the bound method `ParentType<String>.foo`, whereas an implicitly-qualified `foo()` `MethodAccess`'s `getMethod()` would return the unbound method `ParentType.foo`. Now both scenarios produce a bound method. This means that all data-flow queries may return more results where a relevant path transits a call to such an implicitly-qualified call to a member method with a bound generic type, while queries that inspect the result of `MethodAccess.getMethod()` may need to tolerate bound generic methods in more circumstances. The queries `java/iterator-remove-failure`, `java/non-static-nested-class`, `java/internal-representation-exposure`, `java/subtle-inherited-call` and `java/deprecated-call` have been amended to properly handle calls to bound generic methods, and in some instances may now produce more results in the explicit-`this` case as well.
