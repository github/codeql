<overview>
<p>Most collections in the Java standard library are defined by an abstract interface
(for example <code>java.util.List</code> or <code>java.util.Set</code>), which is
implemented by a range of concrete classes and a range of wrappers. Normally, except
when constructing an object, it is better to use the abstract types because this avoids
assumptions about what the implementation is.</p>

<p>A cast from an abstract to a concrete collection
makes the code brittle by ensuring it works only for one possible
implementation class and not others. Usually, such casts are
either an indication of over-reliance on concrete implementation types, or of the
fact that the wrong abstract type was used.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>It is usually best to use the abstract type consistently in variable, field and parameter
declarations.</p>

<p>There may be individual exceptions. For example, it is common to declare variables
as <code>LinkedHashSet</code> rather than <code>Set</code> when the iteration order
matters and only the <code>LinkedHashSet</code> implementation provides the right
behavior.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example illustrates a situation where the wrong abstract type is used.
The <code>List</code> interface does not provide a <code>poll</code> method, so
the original code casts <code>queue</code> down to the concrete type <code>LinkedList</code>, which
does. To avoid this downcasting, simply use the correct abstract type for this method, namely
<code>Queue</code>. This documents the intent of the programmer and allows for various implementations
of queues to be used by clients of this method.</p>
