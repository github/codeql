<overview>
<p>
In most cases, calling the default implementation of <code>toString</code> in <code>java.lang.Object</code> is not what is intended when
a string representation of an object is required. The output of the default <code>toString</code> method consists of the class name of the object 
as well as the object's hashcode, which is usually not what was intended.
</p>
<p>
This rule includes explicit and implicit calls to <code>toString</code> that resolve to <code>java.lang.Object.toString</code>, particularly
calls that are used in print or log statements.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
For objects that are printed, define a <code>toString</code> method for the object that returns a human-readable string.
</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows that printing an object makes an implicit call to <code>toString</code>.
Because the class <code>WrongPerson</code> does not have a <code>toString</code> method, 
<code>Object.toString</code> is called instead, which returns the class name and the <code>wp</code> object's hashcode.</p>

<sample src="DefaultToString.java" />

<p>In contrast, in the following modification of the example, the class <code>Person</code> does have a <code>toString</code> method, which returns a 
string containing the arguments that were passed when the object <code>p</code> was created.</p>
