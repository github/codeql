<overview>
<p>A local variable is initialized, but the variable is never read or written to subsequently. This suggests
that the local variable is either unnecessary and should be removed, or that the value was intended to be used
somewhere.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Ensure that you check the control and data flow in the method carefully.
If a value is really not needed, consider removing the variable. Be careful,
though: if the right-hand side has a side-effect (like performing a method call),
it is important to keep this to preserve the overall behavior.</p>
