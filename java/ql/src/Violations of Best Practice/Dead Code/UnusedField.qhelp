<overview>
<p>A field that is neither public nor protected and never accessed
is typically a leftover from old refactorings or a sign of incomplete or pending
code changes.</p>

<p>This rule does not apply to a field in a serializable class because it may be accessed during 
serialization and deserialization.</p>

<p>Fields annotated with <code>@SuppressWarnings("unused")</code> are also not reported.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>If an unused field is a leftover from old refactorings, you should just remove it. If it indicates
incomplete or pending code changes, finish making the changes and remove the field if it is not
needed.</p>
