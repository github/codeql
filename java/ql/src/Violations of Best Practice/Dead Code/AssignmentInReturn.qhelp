<overview>
<p>An assignment is an expression. The value of an assignment expression
is the value assigned to the variable. This can be useful, for example, when
initializing two or more variables at once (for example, <code>a = b = 0;</code>).
However, assigning to a local variable in the expression of a return statement
is redundant because that value can never be read.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Remove the redundant assignment from the <code>return</code> statement, leaving just the
right-hand side of the assignment.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In the following example, consider the second assignment to <code>ret</code>. The variable goes
out of scope when the method returns, and the value assigned to it is never read. Therefore,
the assignment is redundant. Instead, the last line of the method can be changed to
<code>return Math.max(ret, c);</code></p>
