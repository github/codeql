<overview>
<p>A value is assigned to a local variable, but the local variable is only 
read before the assignment, not after it.
This means that the assignment is suspect, because the state of the local variable that
it creates is never used.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Ensure that you check the control and data flow in the method carefully.
If a value is really not needed, consider omitting the assignment. Be careful,
though: if the right-hand side has a side-effect (like performing a method call),
it is important to keep this to preserve the overall behavior.</p>
