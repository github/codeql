<overview>
<p>A field that has the same name as a field in a superclass <em>hides</em> the field in the superclass.
Such hiding might be unintentional, especially if there are no references to the hidden field using
the <code>super</code> qualifier. In any case, it makes code more difficult to read.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that any hiding is intentional. For clarity, it may be better to rename the field in the
subclass.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<p>In the following example, the programmer unintentionally added an <code>age</code> field to <code>Employee</code>, which
hides the <code>age</code> field in <code>Person</code>. The constructor in <code>Person</code> sets the <code>age
</code> field in <code>Person</code> to 20 but the <code>age</code> field in <code>Employee</code>  
is still 0. This means that the program outputs 0, which is probably not what was intended.</p>
<sample src="FieldMasksSuperField.java" />
<p>To fix this, delete the declaration of <code>age</code> on line 11.</p>
</example>
