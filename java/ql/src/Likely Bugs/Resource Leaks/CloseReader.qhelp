<overview>
<p>A subclass of <code>Reader</code> or <code>InputStream</code> that is opened for reading
but not closed may cause a resource leak. 
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that the resource is always closed to avoid a resource leak. Note that, because of exceptions,
it is safest to close a resource in a <code>finally</code> block. (However, this is unnecessary for
subclasses of <code>CharArrayReader</code>, <code>StringReader</code> and <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code>.)
</p>

<p>For Java 7 or later, the recommended way to close resources that implement <code>java.lang.AutoCloseable</code>
is to declare them within a <code>try-with-resources</code> statement, so that they are closed implicitly.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In the following example, the resource <code>br</code> is opened but not closed.</p>

<sample src="CloseReader.java" />

<p>In the following example, the resource <code>br</code> is opened in a <code>try</code> block and 
later closed in a <code>finally</code> block.</p>

<sample src="CloseReaderGood.java" />

<p>Note that nested class instance creation expressions of <code>Reader</code>s or <code>InputStream</code>s
are not safe to use if the constructor of the outer expression may throw an exception. In the following
example, the <code>InputStreamReader</code> may throw an exception, in which case the inner <code>FileInputStream</code>
is not closed.
</p>

<sample src="CloseReaderNested.java" />

<p>
In this case, the inner expression needs to be assigned to a local variable and closed separately, as shown below.
