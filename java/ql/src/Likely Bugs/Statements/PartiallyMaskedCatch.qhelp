<overview>
<p>
An unreachable <code>catch</code> clause may indicate a logical mistake in the exception handling code
or may simply be unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
Although certain unreachable <code>catch</code> clauses cause a compiler error,
there are also unreachable <code>catch</code> clauses that do not cause a compiler error.
A <code>catch</code> clause <code>C</code> is considered reachable by the compiler if both of the
following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A checked exception that is thrown in the <code>try</code> block is assignable
  to the parameter of <code>C</code>.</li>
  <li>There is no previous <code>catch</code> clause whose parameter type is
  equal to, or a supertype of, the parameter type of <code>C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a <code>catch</code> clause that is considered reachable by the compiler can be
unreachable if both of the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>catch</code> clause's parameter type <code>E</code> does not include any unchecked exceptions.</li>
  <li>All exceptions that are thrown in the <code>try</code> block whose type is a (strict) subtype of <code>E</code>
  are already handled by previous <code>catch</code> clauses.</li>
</ul>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>
Ensure that unreachable <code>catch</code> clauses are removed or that further corrections are made
to make them reachable.
</p>
<p>
Note that if a <code>try-catch</code> statement contains multiple <code>catch</code>
clauses, and an exception that is thrown in the <code>try</code> block matches more
than one of the <code>catch</code> clauses, only the first matching clause is executed.
</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>
In the following example, the second <code>catch</code> clause is unreachable.
The code is incomplete because a <code>FileOutputStream</code> is opened but
no methods are called to write to the stream. Such methods typically throw
<code>IOException</code>s, which would make the second <code>catch</code> clause
reachable.
