<overview>
<p>Assigning a variable to itself does not have any effect. Therefore, such an assignment is either
completely unnecessary, or it indicates a typo or a similar mistake.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>If the assignment is unnecessary, remove it. If the assignment indicates a typo or a similar mistake, correct
the mistake.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows part of a method that is intended to make a copy of an existing 
<code>MotionEvent</code> without preserving its history. On line 8, <code>o.mFlags</code> is
assigned to itself. Given that the statement is surrounded by
statements that transfer information from the fields of <code>o</code> to the
fields of the new event, <code>ev</code>, the statement is clearly a mistake. To correct this, the 
<code>mFlags</code> value should be assigned to <code>ev.mFlags</code> instead, as shown in the
corrected method.</p>
