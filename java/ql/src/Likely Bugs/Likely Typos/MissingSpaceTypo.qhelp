<overview>
<p>
Splitting a long string literal over multiple lines can often aid readability,
but this also makes it difficult to notice whether a space is missing where the
strings are concatenated.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Check the string literal to see whether it has the intended text.
In particular, look for missing spaces near line breaks.
