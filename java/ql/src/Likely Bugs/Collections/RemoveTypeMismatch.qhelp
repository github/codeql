<overview>
<p>The <code>remove</code> method of the <code>Collection</code> interface 
has an argument of type <code>Object</code>. Therefore, you can try to remove an object 
of any type from a collection, regardless of the collection's element type. However, 
although you can call <code>remove</code> with an argument of a different type than that of the collection, 
it is unlikely that the collection actually 
contains an object of this type.
</p>

<p>Similar considerations apply to other container modification methods, such as <code>Map.remove</code>,
where the argument may also have type <code>Object</code>.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that you use the correct argument with a call to <code>remove</code>.
</p>

<example>

<p>In the following example, although the argument to <code>contains</code> is an integer, the code 
does not result in a type error because the argument to <code>remove</code> does not have to match 
the type of the elements of <code>list</code>. However, the argument is unlikely to be found and 
removed (and the body of the <code>if</code> statement is therefore not executed), so it is probably
a typographical error: the argument should be enclosed in quotation marks.

<p>
Note that you must take particular care when working with collections over boxed types,
as illustrated in the following example. The first call to <code>remove</code> fails
because you cannot compare two boxed numeric primitives of different types, in this case <code>Short(1)</code>
(in <code>set</code>) and <code>Integer(1)</code> (the argument). Therefore, <code>remove</code>
cannot find the item to remove. The second call to <code>remove</code> succeeds because you can 
compare <code>Short(1)</code> and <code>Short(1)</code>. Therefore, <code>remove</code> can find the 
item to remove.
