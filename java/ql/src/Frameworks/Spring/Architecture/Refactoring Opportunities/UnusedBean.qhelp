<p>
Bean definitions that are specified but are never used are redundant and can be removed. Unused
beans make the program harder to understand.
</p>
<p>
A bean definition is considered to be used if one or more of the following is true:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The bean is referenced or defined in the <code>&lt;constructor-arg&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;property&gt;</code> element of a live bean.</li>
<li>The bean is injected in to a constructor or method of a live bean due to autowiring. This includes
autowiring by annotation (<code>@Autowired</code> or <code>@Inject</code>), and autowiring configured
by the autowired attribute within bean configuration files.</li>
<li>The bean is explicitly loaded from a factory bean. It is not always possible to determine when
this occurs, because factory beans are loaded using a <code>String</code> value, which may contain
arbitrary values.</li>
<li>The bean is called reflectively by the Spring framework. For example, if the class is a Spring
MVC framework controller, it may be called in response to web requests.</li>
<li>The bean has a static initializer.</li>
<li>The bean is not lazy, and has a constructor or instance initializer that modifies state outside
of the bean.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any bean which is not used in one or more ways will be marked as "dead".
</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
First verify that the bean definition is never used at runtime. In some cases beans may be used in
framework-specific ways, or may be loaded by name from a bean factory in a way that is impossible
to determine statically.
</p>
<p>
After confirming that the bean is not required, remove the bean. You will also need remove any
references to this bean, which may, in turn, require removing other beans or references.
</p>
</recommendation>
<example>
<p>The following example shows a configuration file that includes two beans:</p>
<sample src="UnusedBean.xml"/>
<p>This XML file is loaded with the following Java class:</p>
<sample src="UnusedBean.java" />
<p>
This class constructs a Spring <code>ApplicationContext</code> using the XML file, then loads the
"petStore" bean. Given these two files, the "clinic" bean will be marked as dead because it is
not used in any context, unlike the "petStore" bean.
