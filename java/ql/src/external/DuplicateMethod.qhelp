<overview>
<p>A method should never be duplicated exactly in several places in the code.
The severity of this problem is higher for longer methods than for extremely short
methods of one or two statements, but there are usually better ways of achieving the same
effect.</p>

<p>Code duplication in general is highly undesirable for a range of reasons. The artificially
inflated amount of code is more difficult to understand, and sequences of similar but subtly different lines
can mask the real purpose or intention behind them. Also, there is always a risk that only one
of several copies of the code is updated to address a defect or add a feature.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>At its simplest, the duplication can be addressed by simply removing all but one of the duplicate
method definitions, and changing calls to the removed methods so that they call the remaining function
instead.</p>

<p>This may not be possible because of visibility or accessibility. A common example is
where two classes implement the same functionality but neither is a subtype of the other,
so it is not possible to inherit a single method definition. In such cases, introducing a
common superclass to share the duplicated code is a possible option. Alternatively, if the methods
do not need access to private object state, they can be moved to a shared utility class that
just provides the functionality itself.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In the following example, <code>RowWidget</code> and <code>ColumnWidget</code> contain duplicate
methods. The <code>collectChildren</code> method should probably be moved into the
superclass, <code>Widget</code>, and shared between <code>RowWidget</code> and
<code>ColumnWidget</code>.</p>

<sample src="DuplicateMethod.java" />

<p>Alternatively, if not all kinds of <code>Widget</code> actually need <code>collectChildren</code>
(for example, not all of them have children), it might be necessary to introduce
a new, possibly abstract, class under <code>Widget</code>. For example, the new class might be called
<code>ContainerWidget</code> and include a single definition of <code>collectChildren</code>. Both
<code>RowWidget</code> and <code>ColumnWidget</code> could extend the class and inherit
<code>collectChildren</code>.</p>

<p>Modern IDEs may provide refactoring support for this sort of issue, usually
with the names "Pull up" or "Extract supertype".</p>
