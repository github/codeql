<overview>
<p>The Java Shell tool (JShell) is an interactive tool for learning the Java programming 
language and prototyping Java code. JShell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL), which 
evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately 
shows the results. If an expression is built using attacker-controlled data and then evaluated, 
it may allow the attacker to run arbitrary code.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>It is generally recommended to avoid using untrusted input in a JShell expression.
If it is not possible, JShell expressions should be run in a sandbox that allows accessing only 
explicitly allowed classes.</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The following example calls <code>JShell.eval(...)</code> or <code>SourceCodeAnalysis.wrappers(...)</code> 
to execute untrusted data.</p>
