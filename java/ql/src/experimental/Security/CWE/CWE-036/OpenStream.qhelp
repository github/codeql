<overview>
<p>Calling <code>openStream</code> on URLs created from remote source can lead to local file disclosure.</p>
<p>If <code>openStream</code> is called on a <code>java.net.URL</code>, that was created from a remote source,
an attacker can try to pass absolute URLs starting with <code>file://</code> or <code>jar://</code> to access
local resources in addition to remote ones.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>When you construct a URL using <code>java.net.URL</code> from a remote source,
don't call <code>openStream</code> on it. Instead, use an HTTP Client to fetch the URL and access its content.
You should also validate the URL to check that it uses the correct protocol and host combination.</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The following example shows an URL that is constructed from a request parameter. Afterwards <code>openStream</code>
is called on the URL, potentially leading to a local file access.</p>
<sample src="OpenStream.java" />
