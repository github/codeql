  <overview>
    <p>Debug code can create unintended entry points in a deployed Java EE web application therefore should never make into production. There is no reason to have a main method in a Java EE web application. Having a main method in the Java EE application increases the attack surface that an attacker can exploit to attack the application logic.</p>
  </overview>

  <recommendation>
    <p>Remove the main method from web components including servlets, filters, and listeners.</p>
  </recommendation>

  <example>
    <p>The following example shows two ways of implementing web components. In the 'BAD' case, a main method is implemented. In the 'GOOD' case, no main method is implemented.</p>
