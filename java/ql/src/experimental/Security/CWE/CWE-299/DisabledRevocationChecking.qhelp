<overview>
<p>Validating a certificate chain includes multiple steps. One of them is checking whether or not
certificates in the chain have been revoked. A certificate may be revoked due to multiple reasons. 
One of the reasons why the certificate authority (CA) may revoke a certificate is that its private key
has been compromised. For example, the private key might have been stolen by an adversary.
In this case, the adversary may be able to impersonate the owner of the private key.
Therefore, trusting a revoked certificate may be dangerous.</p>

<p>The Java Certification Path API provides a revocation checking mechanism 
that supports both CRL and OCSP.
Revocation checking happens while building and validating certificate chains.
If at least one of the certificates is revoked, then an exception is thrown.
This mechanism is enabled by default. However, it may be disabled
by passing <code>false</code> to the <code>PKIXParameters.setRevocationEnabled()</code> method.
If an application doesn't set a custom <code>PKIXRevocationChecker</code> 
via <code>PKIXParameters.addCertPathChecker()</code> 
or <code>PKIXParameters.setCertPathCheckers()</code> methods,
then revocation checking is not going to happen.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>An application should not disable the default revocation checking mechanism
unless it provides a custom revocation checker.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example turns off revocation checking for validating a certificate chain.
That should be avoided.</p>

<sample src="NoRevocationChecking.java" />

<p>The next example uses the default revocation checking mechanism.</p>

<sample src="DefaultRevocationChecking.java" />

<p>The third example turns off the default revocation mechanism. However, it registers another 
revocation checker that uses OCSP to obtain revocation status of certificates.</p>

<sample src="CustomRevocationChecking.java" />
