<overview>
<p>The <code>String</code> class is immutable, which means that there is
no way to change the string that it represents. Consequently, there is rarely a
need to copy a <code>String</code> object or construct a new instance based on
an existing string, for example by writing something like <code>String hello =
new String("hello")</code>. Furthermore, this practice is not memory efficient.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>The copied string is functionally indistinguishable from the argument that
was passed into the <code>String</code> constructor, so you can simply omit the constructor call and 
use the argument passed into it directly. Unless an explicit copy of the argument string is needed, 
this is a safe transformation.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows three cases of copying a string using the <code>String</code> 
constructor, which is inefficient. In each case, simply removing the constructor call 
<code>new String</code> and leaving the argument results in better code and less
memory churn.</p>
