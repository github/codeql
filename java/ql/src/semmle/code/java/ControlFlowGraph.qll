/**
 * Provides classes and predicates for computing expression-level intra-procedural control flow graphs.
 *
 * The only API exported by this library are the toplevel classes `ControlFlowNode`
 * and its subclass `ConditionNode`, which wrap the successor relation and the
 * concept of true- and false-successors of conditions. A cfg node may either be a
 * statement, an expression, or the enclosing callable, indicating that
 * execution of the callable terminates.
 */

/*
 * The implementation is centered around the concept of a _completion_, which
 * models how the execution of a statement or expression terminates.
 * Completions are represented as an algebraic data type `Completion` defined in
 * `Completion.qll`.
 *
 * The CFG is built by structural recursion over the AST. To achieve this the
 * CFG edges related to a given AST node, `n`, is divided into three categories:
 *   1. The in-going edge that points to the first CFG node to execute when the
 *      `n` is going to be executed.
 *   2. The out-going edges for control-flow leaving `n` that are going to some
 *      other node in the surrounding context of `n`.
 *   3. The edges that have both of their end-points entirely within the AST
 *      node and its children.
 * The edges in (1) and (2) are inherently non-local and are therefore
 * initially calculated as half-edges, that is, the single node, `k`, of the
 * edge contained within `n`, by the predicates `k = first(n)` and
 * `last(n, k, _)`, respectively. The edges in (3) can then be enumerated
 * directly by the predicate `succ` by calling `first` and `last` recursively
 * on the children of `n` and connecting the end-points. This yields the entire
 * CFG, since all edges are in (3) for _some_ AST node.
 *
 * The third parameter of `last` is the completion, which is necessary to
 * distinguish the out-going edges from `n`. Note that the completion changes
 * as the calculation of `last` proceeds outward through the AST; for example,
 * a `breakCompletion` is caught up by its surrounding loop and turned into a
 * `normalCompletion`, or a `normalCompletion` proceeds outward through the end
 * of a `finally` block and is turned into whatever completion was caught by
 * the `finally`, or a `booleanCompletion(false, _)` occurs in a loop condition
 * and is turned into a `normalCompletion` of the entire loop. When the edge is
 * eventually connected we use the completion at that level of the AST as the
 * label of the edge, thus creating an edge-labelled CFG.
 *
 * An important goal of the CFG is to get the order of side-effects correct.
 * Most expressions can have side-effects and must therefore be modeled in the
 * CFG in AST post-order. For example, a `MethodAccess` evaluates its arguments
 * before the call. Most statements don't have side-effects, but merely affect
 * the control-flow and some could therefore be excluded from the CFG. However,
 * as a design choice, all statements are included in the CFG and generally
 * serve as their own entry-points, thus executing in some version of AST
 * pre-order. A few notable exceptions are `ReturnStmt`, `ThrowStmt`,
 * `SynchronizedStmt`, `ThisConstructorInvocationStmt`, and
 * `SuperConstructorInvocationStmt`, which all have side-effects and therefore
 * are modeled in side-effect order. Loop statement nodes are only passed on
 * entry, after which control goes back and forth between body and loop
 * condition.
 *
 * Some out-going edges from boolean expressions have a known value and in some
 * contexts this affects the possible successors. For example, in `if(A || B)`
 * a short-circuit edge that skips `B` must be true and can therefore only lead
 * to the then-branch. If the `||` is modeled in post-order then this
 * information is lost, and consequently it is better to model `||` and `&&` in
 * pre-order. The conditional expression `? :` is also modeled in pre-order to
 * achieve consistent CFGs for the equivalent `A && B` and `A ? B : false`.
 * Finally, the logical negation is also modeled in pre-order to achieve
 * consistent CFGs for the equivalent `!(A || B)` and `!A && !B`. The boolean
 * value `b` is tracked with the completion `booleanCompletion(b, _)`.
 *
 * Note that the second parameter in a `booleanCompletion` isn't needed to
 * calculate the CFG. It is, however, needed to track the value of the
 * sub-expression. For example, this ensures that the false-successor of the
 * `ConditionNode` `A` in `if(!(A && B))` can be correctly identified as the
 * then-branch (even though this completion turns into a
 * `booleanCompletion(true, _)` from the perspective of the `if`-node).
 *
 * As a final note, expressions that aren't actually executed in the usual
 * sense are excluded from the CFG. This covers, for example, parentheses,
 * l-values that aren't r-values as well, and expressions in `ConstCase`s.
 * For example, the `x` in `x=3` is not in the CFG, but the `x` in `x+=3` is.
