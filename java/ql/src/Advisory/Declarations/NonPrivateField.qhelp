<overview>
<p>A non-final or non-static field that is not declared <code>private</code>,
but is not accessed outside of its declaring type, may decrease code maintainability. This is because
a field that is accessible from outside the class that it is declared in tends to restrict the class 
to a particular implementation.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>In the spirit of encapsulation, it is generally advisable to choose the
most restrictive access modifier (<code>private</code>) for a field, unless
there is a good reason to increase its visibility.
