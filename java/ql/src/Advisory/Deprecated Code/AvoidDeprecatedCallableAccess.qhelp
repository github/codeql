<overview>
<p>
A method (or constructor) can be marked as deprecated using either the <code>@Deprecated</code> 
annotation or the <code>@deprecated</code> Javadoc tag. Using a method that has been 
marked as deprecated is bad practice, typically for one or more of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The method is dangerous.</li>
<li>There is a better alternative method.</li>
<li>Methods that are marked as deprecated are often removed from future versions of an API. So using 
a deprecated method may cause extra maintenance effort when the API is upgraded.</li>
</ul>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Avoid using a method that has been marked as deprecated. Follow any guidance that
is provided with the <code>@deprecated</code> Javadoc tag, which should explain how to replace the 
call to the deprecated method.
