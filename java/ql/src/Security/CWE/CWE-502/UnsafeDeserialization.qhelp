<overview>
<p>
Deserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that
allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable
and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Even before a
deserialized object is returned to the caller of a deserialization method a lot
of code may have been executed, including static initializers, constructors,
and finalizers.  Automatic deserialization of fields means that an attacker may
craft a nested combination of objects on which the executed initialization code
may have unforeseen effects, such as the execution of arbitrary code.
</p>
<p>
There are many different serialization frameworks.  This query currently
supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, and Java IO serialization through
<code>ObjectInputStream</code>/<code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Avoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible.  If the
architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects,
for example JSON or XML.  However, these formats should not be deserialized
into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack.
For example, XML-based deserialization attacks
are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.

Alternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code, but be aware
of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such
protection measures.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>
The following example calls <code>readObject</code> directly on an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> that is constructed from untrusted data, and is
therefore inherently unsafe.
</p>
<sample src="UnsafeDeserializationBad.java" />

<p>
Rewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types
from the input stream removes the vulnerability.
