<overview>
<p>Using unvalidated input as part of an index into the array can cause the array access
 to throw an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>. This is because there is no guarantee
 that the index provided is within the bounds of the array.</p>

<p>This problem occurs when user input is used as an array index, either directly or following one
or more calculations. If the user input is unsanitized, it may be any value, which  could result in
either a negative index, or an index which is larger than the size of the array, either of which
would result in an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
The index used in the array access should be checked against the bounds of the array before being
 used. The index should be smaller than the array size, and it should not be negative.</p>
</recommendation>
<example>
<p>The following program accesses an element from a fixed size constant array:</p>
<sample src="ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex.java" />
<p>The first access of the <code>productDescriptions</code> array uses the user-provided value as
 the index without performing any checks. If the user provides a negative value, or a value larger
 than the size of the array, then an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> may be thrown.</p>
<p>The second access of the <code>productDescriptions</code> array is contained within a conditional
 expression that verifies the user-provided value is a valid index into the array. This ensures that
 the access operation never throws an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>
