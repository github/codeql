    <p>
      A trust boundary violation occurs when a value is passed from a less trusted context to a more trusted context.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For example, a value that is generated by a less trusted source, such as a user, may be passed to a more trusted
      source, such as a system process. If the less trusted source is malicious, then the value may be crafted to
      exploit the more trusted source.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trust boundary violations are often caused by a failure to validate input. For example, if a web application
      accepts a cookie from a user, then the application should validate the cookie before using it. If the cookie is
      not validated, then the user may be able to craft a malicious cookie that exploits the application.
    </p>

  <recommendation>
    <p>
      To maintain a trust boundary, validate data from less trusted sources before use.
    </p>
  </recommendation>

  <example>
    <p>
      In the first (bad) example, the server accepts a parameter from the user, then uses it to set the username without validation.
    </p>
    <sample src="TrustBoundaryVulnerable.java" />

    <p>
      In the second (good) example, the server validates the parameter from the user, then uses it to set the username.
    </p>
    <sample src="TrustBoundaryFixed.java" />
