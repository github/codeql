<overview>
<p>Directly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to an HTTP header
can lead to an HTTP request-splitting or response-splitting vulnerability.</p>

<p>HTTP response splitting can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS and cache poisoning.</p>
<p>HTTP request splitting can allow an attacker to inject an additional HTTP request into a client's outgoing socket connection.
This can allow an attacker to perform an SSRF-like attack.</p>

<p>In the context of a servlet container, if the user input includes blank lines
and the servlet container does not escape the blank lines,
then a remote user can cause the response to turn into two separate responses. 
The remote user can then control one or more responses, which is also HTTP response splitting.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>Guard against HTTP header splitting in the same way as guarding against cross-site scripting.
Before passing any data into HTTP headers, either check the data for special characters, or
escape any special characters that are present.</p>

<p>If the code calls Netty API's directly, ensure that the <code>validateHeaders</code> parameter is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The following example shows the 'name' parameter being written to a cookie
in two different ways. The first way writes it directly to the cookie, and thus
is vulnerable to response-splitting attacks. The second way first removes all special
characters, thus avoiding the potential problem.</p>

<example>
<p>The following example shows the use of the library 'netty' with HTTP response-splitting verification configurations.
The second way will verify the parameters before using them to build the HTTP response.</p>

<example>
<p>The following example shows the use of the netty library with configurations for verification of HTTP request splitting.
The second recommended approach in the example verifies the parameters before using them to build the HTTP request.</p>
