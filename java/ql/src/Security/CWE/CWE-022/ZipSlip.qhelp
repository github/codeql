<overview>
<p>Extracting files from a malicious zip archive (or another archive format)
without validating that the destination file path
is within the destination directory can cause files outside the destination directory to be
overwritten, due to the possible presence of directory traversal elements (<code>..</code>) in
archive paths.</p>

<p>Zip archives contain archive entries representing each file in the archive. These entries
include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain
unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (<code>..</code>). If these
file paths are used to determine an output file to write the contents of the archive item to, then
the file may be written to an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being
revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected
files.</p>

<p>For example, if a zip file contains a file entry <code>..\sneaky-file</code>, and the zip file
is extracted to the directory <code>c:\output</code>, then naively combining the paths would result
in an output file path of <code>c:\output\..\sneaky-file</code>, which would cause the file to be
written to <code>c:\sneaky-file</code>.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing
files to unexpected locations.</p>

<p>The recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to
verify that the normalized full path of the output file starts with a prefix that matches the
destination directory. Path normalization can be done with either
<code>java.io.File.getCanonicalFile()</code> or <code>java.nio.file.Path.normalize()</code>.
Prefix checking can be done with <code>String.startsWith(..)</code>, but it is better to use
<code>java.nio.file.Path.startsWith(..)</code>, as the latter works on complete path segments.
</p>

<p>Another alternative is to validate archive entries against a whitelist of expected files.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>In this example, a file path taken from a zip archive item entry is combined with a
destination directory. The result is used as the destination file path without verifying that
the result is within the destination directory. If provided with a zip file containing an archive
path like <code>..\sneaky-file</code>, then this file would be written outside the destination
directory.</p>

<sample src="ZipSlipBad.java" />

<p>To fix this vulnerability, we need to verify that the normalized <code>file</code> still has
<code>destinationDir</code> as its prefix, and throw an exception if this is not the case.</p>
