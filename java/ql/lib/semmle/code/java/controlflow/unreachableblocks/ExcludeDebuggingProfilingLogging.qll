/**
 * Exclude from the unreachable block analysis constant fields that look like they are flags for
 * controlling debugging, profiling or logging features.
 *
 * Debugging, profiling and logging flags that are compile time constants are usually intended to be
 * toggled by the developer at compile time to provide extra information when developing the
 * application, or when triaging a problem. By including this sub-class, blocks that are unreachable
 * because they are guarded by a check of such a flag are considered reachable.
 *
 * Note: we explicitly limit this to debugging, profiling and logging flags. True feature toggles
 * are treated as constant true/false, because it is much less likely that they are toggled in
 * practice.
