## 0.7.1

### New Features

* The `DataFlow::StateConfigSig` signature module has gained default implementations for `isBarrier/2` and `isAdditionalFlowStep/4`. 
  Hence it is no longer needed to provide `none()` implementations of these predicates if they are not needed.
* A `Class.isFileClass()` predicate, to identify Kotlin file classes, has been added.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flow configurations can now include a predicate `neverSkip(Node node)`
  in order to ensure inclusion of certain nodes in the path explanations. The
  predicate defaults to the end-points of the additional flow steps provided in
  the configuration, which means that such steps now always are visible by
  default in path explanations.
* Added models for Apache Commons Lang3 `ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString` method.
* Added support for the Kotlin method `apply`.
* Added models for the following packages:

  * java.io
  * java.lang
  * java.net
  * java.nio.channels
  * java.nio.file
  * java.util.zip
  * okhttp3
  * org.gradle.api.file
  * retrofit2
