## 5.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the old deprecated data flow API that was based on extending a configuration class. See https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-14-new-dataflow-api-for-writing-custom-codeql-queries for instructions on migrating your queries to use the new API.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Calling `coll.contains(x)` is now a taint sanitizer (for any query) for the value `x`, where `coll` is a collection of constants.
