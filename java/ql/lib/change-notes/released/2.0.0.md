## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* The Java extractor no longer supports the `SEMMLE_DIST` legacy environment variable.

### Deprecated APIs

* The predicate `isAndroid` from the module `semmle.code.java.security.AndroidCertificatePinningQuery` has been deprecated. Use `semmle.code.java.frameworks.android.Android::inAndroidApplication(File)` instead.

### New Features

* Kotlin support is now out of beta, and generally available
* Kotlin versions up to 2.0.2*x* are now supported.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added a path-injection sink for `hudson.FilePath.exists()`.
* Added summary models for `org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray`.
* Java build-mode `none` analyses now only report a warning on the CodeQL status page when there are significant analysis problems-- defined as 5% of expressions lacking a type, or 5% of call targets being unknown. Other messages reported on the status page are downgraded from warnings to notes and so are less prominent, but are still available for review.
