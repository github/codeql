## 0.8.0

### New Features

* Kotlin versions up to 1.9.20 are now supported.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a control-flow bug where case rule statements would incorrectly include a fall-through edge.
* Added support for default cases as proper guards in switch expressions to match switch statements.
* Improved the class `ArithExpr` of the `Overflow.qll` module to also include compound operators. Because of this, new alerts may be raised in queries related to overflows/underflows.
* Added new dataflow models for the Apache CXF framework.
* Regular expressions containing multiple parse mode flags are now interpretted correctly. For example `"(?is)abc.*"` with both the `i` and `s` flags.

### Bug Fixes

* The regular expressions library no longer incorrectly matches mode flag characters against the input.
