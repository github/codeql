## 0.7.4

### New Features

* Kotlin versions up to 1.9.10 are now supported.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed the MaD signature specifications to use proper nested type names.
* Added new sanitizer to Java command injection model
* Added more dataflow models for JAX-RS.
* The predicate `JaxWsEndpoint::getARemoteMethod` no longer requires the result to be annotated with `@WebMethod`. Instead, the requirements listed in the JAX-RPC Specification 1.1 for required parameter and return types are used. Applications using JAX-RS may see an increase in results.
