## 3.0.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Threat-model for `System.in` changed from `commandargs` to newly created `stdin` (both subgroups of `local`).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where analysis in `build-mode: none` may very occasionally throw a `CoderMalfunctionError` while resolving dependencies provided by a build system (Maven or Gradle), which could cause some dependency resolution and consequently alerts to vary unpredictably from one run to another.
* Fixed an issue where Java analysis in `build-mode: none` would fail to resolve dependencies using the `executable-war` Maven artifact type.
* Fixed an issue where analysis in `build-mode: none` may fail to resolve dependencies of Gradle projects where the dependency uses a non-empty artifact classifier -- for example, `someproject-1.2.3-tests.jar`, which has the classifier `tests`.
