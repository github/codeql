## 0.3.1

### New Features

* Added an `ErrorType` class. An instance of this class will be used if an extractor is unable to extract a type, or if an up/downgrade script is unable to provide a type.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added data-flow models for `java.util.Properties`. Additional results may be found where relevant data is stored in and then retrieved from a `Properties` instance.
* Added `Modifier.isInline()`.
* Removed Kotlin-specific database and QL structures for loops and `break`/`continue` statements. The Kotlin extractor was changed to reuse the Java structures for these constructs.
* Added additional flow sources for uses of external storage on Android.
