## 7.7.0

### New Features

* The Java extractor and QL libraries now support Java 25.
* Added support for Java 25 compact source files (JEP 512). The new predicate `Class.isImplicit()` identifies classes that are implicitly declared when using compact source files, and the new predicate `CompilationUnit.isCompactSourceFile()` identifies compilation units that contain compact source files.
* Added support for Java 25 module import declarations.
* Add `ModuleImportDeclaration` class.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved support for various assertion libraries, in particular JUnit. This affects the control-flow graph slightly, and in turn affects several queries (mainly quality queries). Most queries should see improved precision (new true positives and fewer false positives), in particular `java/constant-comparison`, `java/index-out-of-bounds`, `java/dereferenced-value-may-be-null`, and `java/useless-null-check`. Some medium precision queries like `java/toctou-race-condition` and `java/unreleased-lock` may see mixed result changes (both slight improvements and slight regressions).
* Added taint flow model for `java.crypto.KDF`.
* Added taint flow model for `java.lang.ScopedValue`.
