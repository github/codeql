## 0.8.10

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Java expressions with erroneous types (e.g. the result of a call whose callee couldn't be resolved during extraction) are now given a CodeQL `ErrorType` more often.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the Java autobuilder overriding the version of Maven used by a project when the Maven wrapper `mvnw` is in use and the `maven-wrapper.jar` file is not present in the repository.
* Some flow steps related to `android.text.Editable.toString` that were accidentally disabled have been re-enabled.
