## 0.4.2

### Deprecated APIs

* Deprecated `ContextStartActivityMethod`. Use `StartActivityMethod` instead.

### New Features

* Added a new predicate, `hasIncompletePermissions`, in the `AndroidProviderXmlElement` class. This predicate detects if a provider element does not provide both read and write permissions.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added support for common patterns involving `Stream.collect` and common collectors like `Collectors.toList()`.
* The class `TypeVariable` now also extends `Modifiable`.
* Added data flow steps for tainted Android intents that are sent to services and receivers.
* Improved the data flow step for tainted Android intents that are sent to activities so that more cases are covered.
