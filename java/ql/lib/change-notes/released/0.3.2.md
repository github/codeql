## 0.3.2

### New Features

* The QL predicate `Expr::getUnderlyingExpr` has been added. It can be used to look through casts and not-null expressions and obtain the underlying expression to which they apply.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The JUnit5 version of `AssertNotNull` is now recognized, which removes related false positives in the nullness queries.
* Added data flow models for `java.util.Scanner`.
