## 0.5.3

### New Features

* Kotlin versions up to 1.8.20 are now supported.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Removed the first argument of `java.nio.file.Files#createTempDirectory(String,FileAttribute[])` as a "create-file" sink.
* Added the first argument of `java.nio.file.Files#copy` as a "read-file" sink for the `java/path-injection` query.
* The data flow library now disregards flow through code that is dead based on some basic constant propagation, for example, guards like `if (1+1>3)`.
