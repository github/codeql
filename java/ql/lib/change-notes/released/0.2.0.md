## 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

* The signature of `allowImplicitRead` on `DataFlow::Configuration` and `TaintTracking::Configuration` has changed from `allowImplicitRead(DataFlow::Node node, DataFlow::Content c)` to `allowImplicitRead(DataFlow::Node node, DataFlow::ContentSet c)`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved the data flow support for the Android class `SharedPreferences$Editor`. Specifically, the fluent logic of some of its methods is now taken into account when calculating data flow.
  * Added flow sources and steps for JMS versions 1 and 2.
  * Added flow sources and steps for RabbitMQ.
  * Added flow steps for `java.io.DataInput` and `java.io.ObjectInput` implementations.
* Added data-flow models for the Spring Framework component `spring-beans`.

### Bug Fixes

* The QL class `JumpStmt` has been made the superclass of `BreakStmt`, `ContinueStmt` and `YieldStmt`. This allows directly using its inherited predicates without having to explicitly cast to `JumpStmt` first.
