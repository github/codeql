## 0.2.2

### Deprecated APIs

* The QL class `FloatingPointLiteral` has been renamed to `FloatLiteral`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a sanitizer of the query `java/android/intent-redirection`. Now, for an intent to be considered
  safe against intent redirection, both its package name and class name must be checked.
