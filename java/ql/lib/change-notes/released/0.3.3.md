## 0.3.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved analysis of the Android class `AsyncTask` so that data can properly flow through its methods according to the life-cycle steps described here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask#the-4-steps.
* Added a data-flow model for the `setProperty` method of `java.util.Properties`. Additional results may be found where relevant data is stored in and then retrieved from a `Properties` instance.
