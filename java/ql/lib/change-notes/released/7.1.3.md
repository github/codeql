## 7.1.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Enum-typed values are now assumed to be safe by most queries. This means that queries may return fewer results where an enum value is used in a sensitive context, e.g. pasted into a query string.
* All existing modelling and support for `javax.persistence` now applies to `jakarta.persistence` as well.
