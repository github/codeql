## 7.4.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The module `semmle.code.java.frameworks.Castor` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* The module `semmle.code.java.frameworks.JYaml` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* The classes `UnsafeHessianInputReadObjectMethod` and `BurlapInputReadObjectMethod` in the module `semmle.code.java.frameworks.HessianBurlap` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* The class `YamlBeansReaderReadMethod` in the module `semmle.code.java.frameworks.YamlBeans` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* The class `MethodApacheSerializationUtilsDeserialize` in the module `semmle.code.java.frameworks.apache.Lang` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### New Features

* You can now add sinks for the query "Deserialization of user-controlled data" (`java/unsafe-deserialization`) using [data extensions](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-language-guides/customizing-library-models-for-java-and-kotlin/#extensible-predicates-used-to-create-custom-models-in-java-and-kotlin) by extending `sinkModel` and using the kind "unsafe-deserialization". The existing sinks that do not require extra logic to determine if they are unsafe are now defined in this way.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The qualifiers of a calls to `readObject` on any classes that implement `java.io.ObjectInput` are now recognised as sinks for `java/unsafe-deserialization`. Previously this was only the case for classes which extend `java.io.ObjectInputStream`.
