## 0.9.0

### Breaking Changes

* The Java extractor no longer supports the `ODASA_SNAPSHOT` legacy environment variable.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Increased the precision of some dataflow models of the class `java.net.URL` by distinguishing the parts of a URL.
* The Java extractor and QL libraries now support Java 22, including support for anonymous variables, lambda parameters and patterns.
* Pattern cases with multiple patterns and that fall through to or from other pattern cases are now supported. The `PatternCase` class gains the new `getPatternAtIndex` and `getAPattern` predicates, and deprecates `getPattern`.
* Added a `path-injection` sink for the `open` methods of the `android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor` class.
