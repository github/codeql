## 4.1.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The `Field.getSourceDeclaration()` predicate has been deprecated. The result was always the original field, so calls to it can simply be removed.
* The `Field.isSourceDeclaration()` predicate has been deprecated. It always holds.
* The `RefType.nestedName()` predicate has been deprecated, and `RefType.getNestedName()` added to replace it.
* The class `ThreatModelFlowSource` has been renamed to `ActiveThreatModelSource` to more clearly reflect it only contains the currently active threat model sources. `ThreatModelFlowSource` has been marked as deprecated.

### New Features

* The Java extractor and QL libraries now support Java 23.
* Kotlin versions up to 2.1.0\ *x* are now supported.
