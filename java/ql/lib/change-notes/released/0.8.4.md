## 0.8.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Switch cases using binding patterns and `case null[, default]` are now supported. Classes `PatternCase` and `NullDefaultCase` are introduced to represent new kinds of case statement.
* Both switch cases and instanceof expressions using record patterns are now supported. The new class `RecordPatternExpr` is introduced to represent record patterns, and `InstanceOfExpr` gains `getPattern` to replace `getLocalVariableDeclExpr`.
* The control-flow graph and therefore dominance information regarding switch blocks in statement context but with an expression rule (e.g. `switch(...) { case 1 -> System.out.println("Hello world!") }`) has been fixed. This reduces false positives and negatives from various queries relating to functions featuring such statements.
