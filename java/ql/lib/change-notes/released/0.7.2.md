## 0.7.2

### New Features

* A `Diagnostic.getCompilationInfo()` predicate has been added.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a typo in the `StdlibRandomSource` class in `RandomDataSource.qll`, which caused the class to improperly model calls to the `nextBytes` method. Queries relying on `StdlibRandomSource` may see an increase in results.
* Improved the precision of virtual dispatch of `java.io.InputStream` methods. Now, calls to these methods will not dispatch to arbitrary implementations of `InputStream` if there is a high-confidence alternative (like a models-as-data summary).
* Added more dataflow steps for `java.io.InputStream`s that wrap other `java.io.InputStream`s.
* Added models for the Struts 2 framework.
* Improved the modeling of Struts 2 sources of untrusted data by tainting the whole object graph of the objects unmarshaled from an HTTP request.
