## 7.8.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* When a code-scanning configuration specifies the `paths:` and/or `paths-ignore:` settings, these are now taken into account by the Java extractor's search for XML and properties files.
* Additional remote flow sources from the `org.springframework.web.socket` package have been modeled. 
* A sanitizer has been added to `java/ssrf` to remove alerts when a regular expression check is used to verify that the value is safe.
* URI template variables of all Spring `RestTemplate` methods are now considered as request forgery sinks. Previously only the `getForObject` method was considered. This may lead to more alerts for the query `java/ssrf`.
* Added more dataflow models of `org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItem`, `javax/jakarta.servlet.http.Part` and  `org.apache.commons.fileupload.util.Streams`.
