## 0.1.0

### Breaking Changes

* The recently added flow-state versions of `isBarrierIn`, `isBarrierOut`, `isSanitizerIn`, and `isSanitizerOut` in the data flow and taint tracking libraries have been removed.
* The `getUrl` predicate of `DeclaredRepository` in `MavenPom.qll` has been renamed to `getRepositoryUrl`. 

### New Features

* There are now QL classes ErrorExpr and ErrorStmt. These may be generated by upgrade or downgrade scripts when databases cannot be fully converted.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added guard preconditon support for assertion methods for popular testing libraries (e.g. Junit 4, Junit 5, TestNG).
