## 7.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the deprecated `isLValue` and `isRValue` predicates from the `VarAccess` class, use `isVarWrite` and `isVarRead` respectively instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `getRhs` predicate from the `VarWrite` class, use `getASource` instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `LValue` and `RValue` classes, use `VarWrite` and `VarRead` respectively instead.
* Deleted a lot of deprecated classes ending in "*Access", use the corresponding "*Call" classes instead.
* Deleted a lot of deprecated predicates ending in "*Access", use the corresponding "*Call" predicates instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `EnvInput` and `DatabaseInput` classes from `FlowSources.qll`, use the threat models feature instead.
* Deleted some deprecated API predicates from `SensitiveApi.qll`, use the Sink classes from that file instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* We now allow classes which don't have any JAX-RS annotations to inherit JAX-RS annotations from superclasses or interfaces. This is not allowed in the JAX-RS specification, but some implementations, like Apache CXF, allow it. This may lead to more alerts being found.
