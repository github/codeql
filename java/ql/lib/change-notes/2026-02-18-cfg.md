* The Java control flow graph (CFG) implementation has been completely
  rewritten. The CFG now includes additional nodes to more accurately represent
  certain constructs. This also means that any existing code that implicitly
  relies on very specific details about the CFG may need to be updated.
  The CFG now only includes the nodes that are reachable from the entry point.
  Additionally, the following breaking changes have been made:
  - `ControlFlowNode.asCall` has been removed - use `Call.getControlFlowNode` instead.
  - `ControlFlowNode.getEnclosingStmt` has been removed.
  - `ControlFlow::ExprNode` has been removed.
  - `ControlFlow::StmtNode` has been removed.
  - `ControlFlow::Node` has been removed - this was merely an alias of
    `ControlFlowNode`, which is still available.
  - Previously deprecated predicates on `BasicBlock` have been removed.
