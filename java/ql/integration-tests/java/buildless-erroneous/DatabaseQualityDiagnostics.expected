This may be caused by problems identifying dependencies or use of generated source code, among other reasons -- see other CodeQL diagnostics reported on the CodeQL status page for more details of possible causes. Addressing these warnings is advisable to avoid false-positive or missing results. If they cannot be addressed, consider scanning Java using either the `autobuild` or `manual` [build modes](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#comparison-of-the-build-modes). | visibilityCliSummaryTable | true |
