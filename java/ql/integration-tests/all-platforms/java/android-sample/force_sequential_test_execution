# We currently have a bug where gradle tests become flaky when executed in parallel
# - sometimes, gradle fails to connect to the gradle daemon.
# Therefore, force this test to run sequentially.
# Additionally, Android SDK on-demand downloading can fail when multiple tests try to download the same SDK in parallel.
