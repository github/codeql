The difference between these old-style Android tests and those without the old-style suffix is that the old-style tests use com.android.tools.build in their top-level build script as shown in the example at https://developer.android.com/studio/build/#top-level before February 2022, whereas the new-style tests only refer to com.android.application and com.android.library as shown in the updated examples published in February 2022.
