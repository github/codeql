/**
 * A JSONObject is an unordered collection of name/value pairs. Its external
 * form is a string wrapped in curly braces with colons between the names and
 * values, and commas between the values and names. The internal form is an
 * object having <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods for accessing
 * the values by name, and <code>put</code> methods for adding or replacing
 * values by name. The values can be any of these types: <code>Boolean</code>,
 * <code>JSONArray</code>, <code>JSONObject</code>, <code>Number</code>,
 * <code>String</code>, or the <code>JSONObject.NULL</code> object. A
 * JSONObject constructor can be used to convert an external form JSON text
 * into an internal form whose values can be retrieved with the
 * <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods, or to convert values into a
 * JSON text using the <code>put</code> and <code>toString</code> methods. A
 * <code>get</code> method returns a value if one can be found, and throws an
 * exception if one cannot be found. An <code>opt</code> method returns a
 * default value instead of throwing an exception, and so is useful for
 * obtaining optional values.
 * <p>
 * The generic <code>get()</code> and <code>opt()</code> methods return an
 * object, which you can cast or query for type. There are also typed
 * <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods that do type checking and type
 * coercion for you. The opt methods differ from the get methods in that they
 * do not throw. Instead, they return a specified value, such as null.
 * <p>
 * The <code>put</code> methods add or replace values in an object. For
 * example,
 *
 * <pre>
 * myString = new JSONObject()
 *         .put(&quot;JSON&quot;, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;).toString();
 * </pre>
 *
 * produces the string <code>{"JSON": "Hello, World"}</code>.
 * <p>
 * The texts produced by the <code>toString</code> methods strictly conform to
 * the JSON syntax rules. The constructors are more forgiving in the texts they
 * will accept:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An extra <code>,</code>&nbsp;<small>(comma)</small> may appear just
 * before the closing brace.</li>
 * <li>Strings may be quoted with <code>'</code>&nbsp;<small>(single
 * quote)</small>.</li>
 * <li>Strings do not need to be quoted at all if they do not begin with a
 * quote or single quote, and if they do not contain leading or trailing
 * spaces, and if they do not contain any of these characters:
 * <code>{ } [ ] / \ : , #</code> and if they do not look like numbers and
 * if they are not the reserved words <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>,
 * or <code>null</code>.</li>
 * </ul>

     * <code>"is"</code> followed by an uppercase letter, the method is invoked,
     * and a key and the value returned from the getter method are put into the
     * new JSONObject.
     * <p>
     * The key is formed by removing the <code>"get"</code> or <code>"is"</code>
     * prefix. If the second remaining character is not upper case, then the
     * first character is converted to lower case.
     * <p>
     * Methods that are <code>static</code>, return <code>void</code>,
     * have parameters, or are "bridge" methods, are ignored.
     * <p>
     * For example, if an object has a method named <code>"getName"</code>, and
     * if the result of calling <code>object.getName()</code> is
     * <code>"Larry Fine"</code>, then the JSONObject will contain
     * <code>"name": "Larry Fine"</code>.
     * <p>
     * The {@link JSONPropertyName} annotation can be used on a bean getter to
     * override key name used in the JSONObject. For example, using the object
     * above with the <code>getName</code> method, if we annotated it with:
     * <pre>
     * &#64;JSONPropertyName("FullName")
     * public String getName() { return this.name; }
     * </pre>
     * The resulting JSON object would contain <code>"FullName": "Larry Fine"</code>
     * <p>
     * Similarly, the {@link JSONPropertyName} annotation can be used on non-
     * <code>get</code> and <code>is</code> methods. We can also override key
     * name used in the JSONObject as seen below even though the field would normally
     * be ignored:
     * <pre>
     * &#64;JSONPropertyName("FullName")
     * public String fullName() { return this.name; }
     * </pre>
     * The resulting JSON object would contain <code>"FullName": "Larry Fine"</code>
     * <p>
     * The {@link JSONPropertyIgnore} annotation can be used to force the bean property
     * to not be serialized into JSON. If both {@link JSONPropertyIgnore} and
     * {@link JSONPropertyName} are defined on the same method, a depth comparison is
     * performed and the one closest to the concrete class being serialized is used.
     * If both annotations are at the same level, then the {@link JSONPropertyIgnore}
     * annotation takes precedent and the field is not serialized.
     * For example, the following declaration would prevent the <code>getName</code>
     * method from being serialized:
     * <pre>
     * &#64;JSONPropertyName("FullName")
     * &#64;JSONPropertyIgnore
     * public String getName() { return this.name; }
