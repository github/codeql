/**
 * An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all
 * activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
 * creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
 * {@link #setContentView}. While activities are often presented to the user as
 * full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating windows
 * (via a theme with {@link android.R.attr#windowIsFloating} set) or embedded
 * inside of another activity (using {@link ActivityGroup}).
 *
 * There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onCreate} is where you initialize your activity. Most
 * importantly, here you will usually call {@link #setContentView(int)} with a
 * layout resource defining your UI, and using {@link #findViewById} to retrieve
 * the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with programmatically.
 *
 * <li>{@link #onPause} is where you deal with the user leaving your activity.
 * Most importantly, any changes made by the user should at this point be
 * committed (usually to the {@link android.content.ContentProvider} holding the
 * data).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * To be of use with {@link android.content.Context#startActivity
 * Context.startActivity()}, all activity classes must have a corresponding
 * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}
 * declaration in their package's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.

 * <p>
 * The Activity class is an important part of an application's overall
 * lifecycle, and the way activities are launched and put together is a
 * fundamental part of the platform's application model. For a detailed
 * perspective on the structure of an Android application and how activities
 * behave, please read the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html">Application
 * Fundamentals</a> and

 * <a name="Fragments"></a>
 * <h3>Fragments</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity} subclass can make use of
 * the {@link android.support.v4.app.Fragment} class to better modularize their
 * code, build more sophisticated user interfaces for larger screens, and help
 * scale their application between small and large screens.
 * </p>
 *

 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/components/fragments.html">Fragments</a> developer
 * guide.

 *
 * <a name="ActivityLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Activity Lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Activities in the system are managed as an <em>activity stack</em>. When a
 * new activity is started, it is placed on the top of the stack and becomes the
 * running activity -- the previous activity always remains below it in the
 * stack, and will not come to the foreground again until the new activity
 * exits.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An activity has essentially four states:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the top of the
 * stack), it is <em>active</em> or <em>running</em>.</li>
 * <li>If an activity has lost focus but is still visible (that is, a new
 * non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your activity), it
 * is <em>paused</em>. A paused activity is completely alive (it maintains all
 * state and member information and remains attached to the window manager), but
 * can be killed by the system in extreme low memory situations.
 * <li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity, it is
 * <em>stopped</em>. It still retains all state and member information, however,
 * it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden and it will often
 * be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.</li>
 * <li>If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity
 * from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its process.
 * When it is displayed again to the user, it must be completely restarted and
 * restored to its previous state.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following diagram shows the important state paths of an Activity. The
 * square rectangles represent callback methods you can implement to perform
 * operations when the Activity moves between states. The colored ovals are
 * major states the Activity can be in.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <img src="../../../images/activity_lifecycle.png" alt="State diagram for an
 * Android Activity Lifecycle." border="0" />
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your
 * activity:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <b>entire lifetime</b> of an activity happens between the first call
 * to {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} through to a single final call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onDestroy}. An activity will do all setup of
 * "global" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in
 * onDestroy(). For example, if it has a thread running in the background to
 * download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate() and
 * then stop the thread in onDestroy().
 *
 * <li>The <b>visible lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onStart} until a corresponding call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}. During this time the user can see the
 * activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting
 * with the user. Between these two methods you can maintain resources that are
 * needed to show the activity to the user. For example, you can register a
 * {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} in onStart() to monitor for changes
 * that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no longer
 * sees what you are displaying. The onStart() and onStop() methods can be
 * called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden to the
 * user.
 *
 * <li>The <b>foreground lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onResume} until a corresponding call to
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}. During this time the activity is in
 * front of all other activities and interacting with the user. An activity can
 * frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when the
 * device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new intent
 * is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly lightweight.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following Activity
 * methods. All of these are hooks that you can override to do appropriate work
 * when the activity changes state. All activities will implement
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} to do their initial setup; many will
 * also implement {@link android.app.Activity#onPause} to commit changes to data
 * and otherwise prepare to stop interacting with the user. You should always
 * call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.
 * </p>
 *

 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note the "Killable" column in the above table -- for those methods that are
 * marked as being killable, after that method returns the process hosting the
 * activity may be killed by the system <em>at any time</em> without another
 * line of its code being executed. Because of this, you should use the
 * {@link #onPause} method to write any persistent data (such as user edits) to
 * storage. In addition, the method {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} is
 * called before placing the activity in such a background state, allowing you
 * to save away any dynamic instance state in your activity into the given
 * Bundle, to be later received in {@link #onCreate} if the activity needs to be
 * re-created. See the <a href="#ProcessLifecycle">Process Lifecycle</a> section
 * for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied to the
 * activities it is hosting. Note that it is important to save persistent data
 * in {@link #onPause} instead of {@link #onSaveInstanceState} because the
 * latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not be called in every
 * situation as described in its documentation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p class="note">
 * Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between applications
 * targeting platforms starting with
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB} vs. those targeting prior
 * platforms. Starting with Honeycomb, an application is not in the killable
 * state until its {@link #onStop} has returned. This impacts when
 * {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} may be called (it may be safely called
 * after {@link #onPause()}) and allows an application to safely wait until
 * {@link #onStop()} to save persistent state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p class="note">
 * For applications targeting platforms starting with
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)}
 * will always be called after {@link #onStop}, so an application may safely
 * perform fragment transactions in {@link #onStop} and will be able to save
 * persistent state later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity's
 * process will not be killed by the system starting from the time the method is
 * called and continuing after it returns. Thus an activity is in the killable
 * state, for example, between after <code>onPause()</code> to the start of
 * <code>onResume()</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="ConfigurationChanges"></a>
 * <h3>Configuration Changes</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the configuration of the device (as defined by the {@link Configuration
 * Resources.Configuration} class) changes, then anything displaying a user
 * interface will need to update to match that configuration. Because Activity
 * is the primary mechanism for interacting with the user, it includes special
 * support for handling configuration changes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change in
 * screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your current
 * activity to be <em>destroyed</em>, going through the normal activity
 * lifecycle process of {@link #onPause}, {@link #onStop}, and
 * {@link #onDestroy} as appropriate. If the activity had been in the foreground
 * or visible to the user, once {@link #onDestroy} is called in that instance
 * then a new instance of the activity will be created, with whatever
 * savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated from
 * {@link #onSaveInstanceState}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is done because any application resource, including layout files, can
 * change based on any configuration value. Thus the only safe way to handle a
 * configuration change is to re-retrieve all resources, including layouts,
 * drawables, and strings. Because activities must already know how to save
 * their state and re-create themselves from that state, this is a convenient
 * way to have an activity restart itself with a new configuration.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your activity
 * based on one or more types of configuration changes. This is done with the
 * {@link android.R.attr#configChanges android:configChanges} attribute in its
 * manifest. For any types of configuration changes you say that you handle
 * there, you will receive a call to your current activity's
 * {@link #onConfigurationChanged} method instead of being restarted. If a
 * configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the
 * activity will still be restarted and {@link #onConfigurationChanged} will not
 * be called.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="StartingActivities"></a>
 * <h3>Starting Activities and Getting Results</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link android.app.Activity#startActivity} method is used to start a new
 * activity, which will be placed at the top of the activity stack. It takes a
 * single argument, an {@link android.content.Intent Intent}, which describes
 * the activity to be executed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it ends. For
 * example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick a person in a list
 * of contacts; when it ends, it returns the person that was selected. To do
 * this, you call the
 * {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)} version with
 * a second integer parameter identifying the call. The result will come back
 * through your {@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an activity exits, it can call
 * {@link android.app.Activity#setResult(int)} to return data back to its
 * parent. It must always supply a result code, which can be the standard
 * results RESULT_CANCELED, RESULT_OK, or any custom values starting at
 * RESULT_FIRST_USER. In addition, it can optionally return back an Intent
 * containing any additional data it wants. All of this information appears back
 * on the parent's <code>Activity.onActivityResult()</code>, along with the
 * integer identifier it originally supplied.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent
 * activity will receive a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * public class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *     ...
 *
 *     static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;
 *
 *     public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
 *         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
 *             // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
 *             startActivityForResult(
 *                 new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
 *                 new Uri("content://contacts")),
 *                 PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);
 *            return true;
 *         }
 *         return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
 *             Intent data) {
 *         if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
 *             if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
 *                 // A contact was picked.  Here we will just display it
 *                 // to the user.
 *                 startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, data));
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <a name="SavingPersistentState"></a>
 * <h3>Saving Persistent State</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are generally two kinds of persistent state than an activity will deal
 * with: shared document-like data (typically stored in a SQLite database using
 * a {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content provider}) and internal
 * state such as user preferences.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For content provider data, we suggest that activities use a "edit in place"
 * user model. That is, any edits a user makes are effectively made immediately
 * without requiring an additional confirmation step. Supporting this model is
 * generally a simple matter of following two rules:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for it is
 * created immediately. For example, if the user chooses to write a new email, a
 * new entry for that email is created as soon as they start entering data, so
 * that if they go to any other activity after that point this email will now
 * appear in the list of drafts.
 * </p>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * When an activity's <code>onPause()</code> method is called, it should commit
 * to the backing content provider or file any changes the user has made. This
 * ensures that those changes will be seen by any other activity that is about
 * to run. You will probably want to commit your data even more aggressively at
 * key times during your activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new
 * activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user switches between
 * input fields, etc.
 * </p>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating between
 * activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because system
 * resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been paused.
 * Note this implies that the user pressing BACK from your activity does
 * <em>not</em> mean "cancel" -- it means to leave the activity with its current
 * contents saved away. Canceling edits in an activity must be provided through
 * some other mechanism, such as an explicit "revert" or "undo" option.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * See the {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content package} for more
 * information about content providers. These are a key aspect of how different
 * activities invoke and propagate data between themselves.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Activity class also provides an API for managing internal persistent
 * state associated with an activity. This can be used, for example, to remember
 * the user's preferred initial display in a calendar (day view or week view) or
 * the user's default home page in a web browser.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Activity persistent state is managed with the method {@link #getPreferences},
 * allowing you to retrieve and modify a set of name/value pairs associated with
 * the activity. To use preferences that are shared across multiple application
 * components (activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the
 * underlying {@link Context#getSharedPreferences
 * Context.getSharedPreferences()} method to retrieve a preferences object
 * stored under a specific name. (Note that it is not possible to share settings
 * data across application packages -- for that you will need a content
 * provider.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here is an excerpt from a calendar activity that stores the user's preferred
 * view mode in its persistent settings:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * public class CalendarActivity extends Activity {
 *     ...
 *
 *     static final int DAY_VIEW_MODE = 0;
 *     static final int WEEK_VIEW_MODE = 1;
 *
 *     private SharedPreferences mPrefs;
 *     private int mCurViewMode;
 *
 *     protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
 *
 *         SharedPreferences mPrefs = getSharedPreferences();
 *         mCurViewMode = mPrefs.getInt("view_mode", DAY_VIEW_MODE);
 *     }
 *
 *     protected void onPause() {
 *         super.onPause();
 *
 *         SharedPreferences.Editor ed = mPrefs.edit();
 *         ed.putInt("view_mode", mCurViewMode);
 *         ed.commit();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <a name="Permissions"></a>
 * <h3>Permissions</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is
 * declared in its manifest's {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity
 * &lt;activity&gt;} tag. By doing so, other applications will need to declare a
 * corresponding {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestUsesPermission
 * &lt;uses-permission&gt;} element in their own manifest to be able to start
 * that activity.
 *
 * <p>
 * When starting an Activity you can set
 * {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
 * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or
 * {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION
 * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} on the Intent. This will grant the
 * Activity access to the specific URIs in the Intent. Access will remain until
 * the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting process being
 * killed and other temporary destruction). As of
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#GINGERBREAD}, if the Activity was
 * already created and a new Intent is being delivered to
 * {@link #onNewIntent(Intent)}, any newly granted URI permissions will be added
 * to the existing ones it holds.
 *
 * <p>
 * See the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and
 * Permissions</a> document for more information on permissions and security in
 * general.
 *
 * <a name="ProcessLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Process Lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Android system attempts to keep an application process around for as long
 * as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when memory
 * runs low. As described in <a href="#ActivityLifecycle">Activity
 * Lifecycle</a>, the decision about which process to remove is intimately tied
 * to the state of the user's interaction with it. In general, there are four
 * states a process can be in based on the activities running in it, listed here
 * in order of importance. The system will kill less important processes (the
 * last ones) before it resorts to killing more important processes (the first
 * ones).
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The <b>foreground activity</b> (the activity at the top of the screen that
 * the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important. Its
 * process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory than is
 * available on the device. Generally at this point the device has reached a
 * memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user interface
 * responsive.
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A <b>visible activity</b> (an activity that is visible to the user but not in
 * the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog) is considered
 * extremely important and will not be killed unless that is required to keep
 * the foreground activity running.
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A <b>background activity</b> (an activity that is not visible to the user and
 * has been paused) is no longer critical, so the system may safely kill its
 * process to reclaim memory for other foreground or visible processes. If its
 * process needs to be killed, when the user navigates back to the activity
 * (making it visible on the screen again), its {@link #onCreate} method will be
 * called with the savedInstanceState it had previously supplied in
 * {@link #onSaveInstanceState} so that it can restart itself in the same state
 * as the user last left it.
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * An <b>empty process</b> is one hosting no activities or other application
 * components (such as {@link Service} or
 * {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} classes). These are killed very
 * quickly by the system as memory becomes low. For this reason, any background
 * operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the context of an

 * Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists
 * independently of the activity lifecycle itself. An example may be a camera
 * application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site. The upload may
 * take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave the
 * application while it is executing. To accomplish this, your Activity should
 * start a {@link Service} in which the upload takes place. This allows the
 * system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more
 * important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the
 * upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped, or
 * finished.

     *
     * <p>
     * This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it comes
     * back some time in the future it can restore its state. For example, if
     * activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity A
     * is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
     * current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
     * returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored via
     * {@link #onCreate} or {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}.
     *
     * <p>
     * Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as
     * {@link #onPause}, which is always called when an activity is being placed in
     * the background or on its way to destruction, or {@link #onStop} which is
     * called before destruction. One example of when {@link #onPause} and
     * {@link #onStop} is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
     * from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call
     * {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on B because that particular instance will never
     * be restored, so the system avoids calling it. An example when
     * {@link #onPause} is called and not {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is when
     * activity B is launched in front of activity A: the system may avoid calling
     * {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on activity A if it isn't killed during the
     * lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of A will stay intact.
     *
     * <p>
     * The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance state
     * for you by calling {@link android.view.View#onSaveInstanceState()} on each
     * view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
     * focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}). If you override this method to save
     * additional information not captured by each individual view, you will likely
     * want to call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to
     * save all of the state of each view yourself.
     *
     * <p>
     * If called, this method will occur after {@link #onStop} for applications
     * targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P}.
     * For applications targeting earlier platform versions this method will occur
     * before {@link #onStop} and there are no guarantees about whether it will
     * occur before or after {@link #onPause}.

     * sure to not do anything lengthy here.
     *

     * editing, to present a "edit in place" model to the user and making sure
     * nothing is lost if there are not enough resources to start the new activity
     * without first killing this one. This is also a good place to do things like
     * stop animations and other things that consume a noticeable amount of CPU in
     * order to make the switch to the next activity as fast as possible, or to
     * close resources that are exclusive access such as the camera.
     *
     * <p>
     * In situations where the system needs more memory it may kill paused processes
     * to reclaim resources. Because of this, you should be sure that all of your
