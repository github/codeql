/**
 * <p>
 * The Builder interface is designed to designate a class as a <em>builder</em>
 * object in the Builder design pattern. Builders are capable of creating and
 * configuring objects or results that normally take multiple steps to construct
 * or are very complex to derive.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The builder interface defines a single method, {@link #build()}, that
 * classes must implement. The result of this method should be the final
 * configured object or result after all building operations are performed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is a recommended practice that the methods supplied to configure the
 * object or result being built return a reference to {@code this} so that
 * method calls can be chained together.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example Builder:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * class FontBuilder implements Builder&lt;Font&gt; {
 *     private Font font;
 *
 *     public FontBuilder(String fontName) {
 *         this.font = new Font(fontName, Font.PLAIN, 12);
 *     }
 *
 *     public FontBuilder bold() {
 *         this.font = this.font.deriveFont(Font.BOLD);
 *         return this; // Reference returned so calls can be chained
 *     }
 *
 *     public FontBuilder size(float pointSize) {
 *         this.font = this.font.deriveFont(pointSize);
 *         return this; // Reference returned so calls can be chained
 *     }
 *
 *     // Other Font construction methods
 *
 *     public Font build() {
 *         return this.font;
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Example Builder Usage:
 * <pre><code>
 * Font bold14ptSansSerifFont = new FontBuilder(Font.SANS_SERIF).bold()
 *                                                              .size(14.0f)
 *                                                              .build();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 *
 * @param <T> the type of object that the builder will construct or compute.
 * @since 1.0
