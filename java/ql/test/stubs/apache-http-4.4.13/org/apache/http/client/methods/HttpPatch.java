/**
 * HTTP PATCH method.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP PATCH method is defined in <a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">RF5789</a>:
 * </p>
 * <blockquote> The PATCH
 * method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be
 * applied to the resource identified by the Request- URI. Differs from the PUT
 * method in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the
 * resource identified by the Request-URI. In a PUT request, the enclosed entity
 * origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be
 * replaced. With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of
 * instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin
 * server should be modified to produce a new version.
