/**
 * HTTP GET method.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP GET method is defined in section 9.3 of
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>: <blockquote> The
 * GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is
 * identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing
 * process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the
 * response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to
 * be the output of the process. </blockquote>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * GetMethods will follow redirect requests from the http server by default.
 * This behavour can be disabled by calling setFollowRedirects(false).
 * </p>
