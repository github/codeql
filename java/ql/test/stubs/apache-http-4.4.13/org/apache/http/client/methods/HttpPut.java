 * HTTP PUT method.

 * The HTTP PUT method is defined in section 9.6 of

 * PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied
 * Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the
 * enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one
 * residing on the origin server. </blockquote>
