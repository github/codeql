**Description of the false positive**

<!-- Please explain briefly why you think it shouldn't be included. -->

**Code samples or links to source code**

<!--
For open source code: file links with line numbers on GitHub, for example:
https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/dc440aaee6695deb0d9676b87e06ea984e1b4ae5/javascript/ql/test/query-tests/Security/CWE-078/CommandInjection/exec-sh2.js#L10

For closed source code: (redacted) code samples that illustrate the problem, for example:

```
function execSh(command, options) {
    return cp.spawn(getShell(), ["-c", command], options) // <- command line injection
};
```
-->

<!--
1. Open the project on GitHub.com.
2. Switch to the `Security` tab.
3. Browse to the alert that you would like to report.
