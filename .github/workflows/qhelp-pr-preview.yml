# This workflow checks for any changes in .qhelp files in pull requests.
# For any changed files, it renders them to markdown in a file called `comment_body.txt`.
# It then checks if there's an existing comment on the pull request generated by
# this workflow, and writes the comment ID to `comment_id.txt`.
# It also writes the PR number to `pr_number.txt`.
# These three files are uploaded as an artifact.

# When this workflow completes, the workflow "Post PR comment" runs.
# It downloads the artifact and adds a comment to the PR with the rendered
# QHelp.

# The task is split like this because creating PR comments requires extra
# permissions that we don't want to expose to PRs from external forks.
