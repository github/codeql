/**
 * The purpose of this file is to control which cached predicates belong to the same stage.
 *
 * Combining stages can improve performance as we are more likely to reuse shared, non-cached predicates.
 *
 * To make a predicate `p` belong to a stage `A`:
 * - make `p` depend on `A::ref()`, and
 * - make `A::backref()` depend on `p`.
 *
 * Since `A` is a cached module, `ref` and `backref` must be in the same stage, and the dependency
 * chain above thus forces `p` to be in that stage as well.
 *
 * With these two predicates in a `cached module` we ensure that all the cached predicates will be in a single stage at runtime.
 *
 * Grouping stages can cause unnecessary computation, as a concrete query might not depend on
 * all the cached predicates in a stage.
 * Care should therefore be taken not to combine two stages, if it is likely that a query only depend
 * on some but not all the cached predicates in the combined stage.
