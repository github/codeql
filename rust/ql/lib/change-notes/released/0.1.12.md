## 0.1.12

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Implemented support for data flow through trait functions. For the purpose of data flow, calls to trait functions dispatch to all possible implementations.
* `AssocItem` and `ExternItem` are now proper subclasses of `Item`.
* Added type inference for `for` loops and array expressions.
