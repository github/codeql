## 0.2.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `Deref` trait is now considered during method resolution. This means that method calls on receivers implementing the `Deref` trait will correctly resolve to methods defined on the target type. This may result in additional query results, especially for data flow queries.
* Renamed the `Adt` class to `TypeItem` and moved common predicates from `Struct`, `Enum`, and `Union` to `TypeItem`.
* Added models for the Axum web application framework.
* Reading content of a value now carries taint if the value itself is tainted. For instance, if `s` is tainted then `s.field` is also tainted. This generally improves taint flow.
* The call graph is now more precise for calls that target a trait function with a default implementation. This reduces the number of false positives for data flow queries.
* Improved type inference for raw pointers (`*const` and `*mut`). This includes type inference for the raw borrow operators (`&raw const` and `&raw mut`) and dereferencing of raw pointers.
