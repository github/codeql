## 0.2.5

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The predicate `SummarizedCallable.propagatesFlow` has been extended with the columns `Provenance p` and `boolean isExact`, and as a consequence the predicates `SummarizedCallable.hasProvenance` and `SummarizedCallable.hasExactModel` have been removed.
* Added type inference support for the `FnMut(..) -> ..` and `Fn(..) -> ..` traits. They now work in type parameter bounds and are implemented by closures.
