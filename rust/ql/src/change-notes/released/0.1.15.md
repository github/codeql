## 0.1.15

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rust/log-injection`, for detecting cases where log entries could be forged by a malicious user.

### Bug Fixes

* The "Low Rust analysis quality" query (`rust/diagnostic/database-quality`) has been tuned so that it won't trigger on databases that have extracted normally. This will remove spurious messages of "Low Rust analysis quality" on the CodeQL status page.
* Fixed an inconsistency across languages where most have a `Customizations.qll` file for adding customizations, but not all did.
