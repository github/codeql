## 0.1.25

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed common false positives for the `rust/unused-variable` and `rust/unused-value` queries.
* Fixed false positives from the `rust/access-invalid-pointer` query, by only considering dereferences of raw pointers as sinks.
* Fixed false positives from the `rust/access-after-lifetime-ended` query, involving calls to trait methods.
* The `rust/hard-coded-cryptographic-value` query has been extended with new heuristic sinks identifying passwords, initialization vectors, nonces and salts.
