* Added a new query, `rust/xxe`, to detect XML external entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in Rust code that uses the `libxml` crate (bindings to C's `libxml2`). The query flags calls to `libxml2` parsing functions with unsafe options (`XML_PARSE_NOENT` or `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD`) when the XML input comes from a user-controlled source.
