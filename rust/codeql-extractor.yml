        title: Controls compression for the TRAP files written by the extractor.
        description: >
          This option is only intended for use in debugging the extractor. Accepted
          values are 'gzip' (to write gzip-compressed TRAP) and 'none'
          (currently the default, to write uncompressed TRAP).

  cargo_target_dir:
    title: Directory to use for cargo output files.
    description: >
      This value is an optional path to use as `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for the internal
      cargo commands the extractor uses. Pointing it to a persistent directory may
      reduce execution time of consecutive extractor runs. By default, a new scratch
      directory is used for each run.
