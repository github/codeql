## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The data flow library now adds intermediate nodes when data flows out of a function via a parameter, in order to make path explanations easier to follow. The intermediate nodes have the same location as the underlying parameter, but must be accessed via `PathNode.asParameterReturnNode` instead of `PathNode.asNode`.
