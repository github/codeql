* Added support for type-based call edge pruning. This removes data flow call edges that are incompatible with the set of flow paths that reach it based on type information. This improves dispatch precision for constructs like lambdas, `Object.toString()` calls, and the visitor pattern. For now this is only enabled for Java and C#.
