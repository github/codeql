# Text files will be normalized to LF line endings in the Git database, and will keep those LF line
# endings in the working tree even on Windows. If you make changes below, you should renormalize the
# affected files by running the following from the root of this repo (requires Git 2.16 or greater):
#
# git add --renormalize .
# git status  [just to show what files were renormalized]
# git commit -m "Normalize line endings"

# Anything Git auto-detects as text gets normalized and checked out as LF
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly set a bunch of known extensions to text, in case auto detection gets confused.
