# Improvements to JavaScript analysis

## General improvements

* TypeScript 3.8 is now supported.

* You can now suppress alerts using either single-line block comments (`/* ... */`) or line comments (`// ...`).

* Resolution of imports has improved, leading to more results from the security queries:
    - Imports with the `.js` extension can now be resolved to a TypeScript file,
      when the import refers to a file generated by TypeScript.
    - Imports that rely on path-mappings from a `tsconfig.json` file can now be resolved.
    - Export declarations of the form `export * as ns from "x"` are now analyzed more precisely.

* The analysis of sanitizers has improved, leading to more accurate results from the security queries.
  In particular:
    - Sanitizer guards now act across function boundaries in more cases.
    - Sanitizers can now better distinguish between a tainted value and an object _containing_ a tainted value.

* Call graph construction has been improved, leading to more results from the security queries:
    - Calls can now be resolved to indirectly-defined class members in more cases.
    - Calls through partial invocations such as `.bind` can now be resolved in more cases.

* Support for flow summaries has been more clearly marked as being experimental and moved to the new `experimental` folder.

* Support for the following frameworks and libraries has been improved:

## Changes to libraries

* The predicates `RegExpTerm.getSuccessor` and `RegExpTerm.getPredecessor` have been changed to reflect textual, not operational, matching order. This only makes a difference in lookbehind assertions, which are operationally matched backwards. Previously, `getSuccessor` would mimick this, so in an assertion `(?<=ab)` the term `b` would be considered the predecessor, not the successor, of `a`. Textually, however, `a` is still matched before `b`, and this is the order we now follow.
* An extensible model of the `EventEmitter` pattern has been implemented.
* Taint-tracking configurations now interact differently with the `data` flow label, which may affect queries
  that combine taint-tracking and flow labels.
    - Sources added by the 1-argument `isSource` predicate are associated with the `taint` label now, instead of the `data` label.
    - Sanitizers now only block the `taint` label. As a result, sanitizers no longer block the flow of tainted values wrapped inside a property of an object.
      To retain the old behavior, instead use a barrier, or block the `data` flow label using a labeled sanitizer.
