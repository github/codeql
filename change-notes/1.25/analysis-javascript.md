## New queries

| **Query**                                                                       | **Tags**                                                          | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cross-site scripting through DOM (`js/xss-through-dom`) | security, external/cwe/cwe-079, external/cwe/cwe-116 | Highlights potential XSS vulnerabilities where existing text from the DOM is used as HTML. Results are not shown on LGTM by default. |
| Incomplete HTML attribute sanitization (`js/incomplete-html-attribute-sanitization`) | security, external/cwe/cwe-20, external/cwe/cwe-079, external/cwe/cwe-116 | Highlights potential XSS vulnerabilities due to incomplete sanitization of HTML meta-characters. Results are shown on LGTM by default. |
| Unsafe expansion of self-closing HTML tag (`js/unsafe-html-expansion`) | security, external/cwe/cwe-079, external/cwe/cwe-116 | Highlights potential XSS vulnerabilities caused by unsafe expansion of self-closing HTML tags. |
| Unsafe shell command constructed from library input (`js/shell-command-constructed-from-input`) | correctness, security, external/cwe/cwe-078, external/cwe/cwe-088 | Highlights potential command injections due to a shell command being constructed from library inputs. Results are shown on LGTM by default. |

## Changes to existing queries

| **Query**                      | **Expected impact**          | **Change**                                                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Misspelled variable name (`js/misspelled-variable-name`) | Message changed | The message for this query now correctly identifies the misspelled variable in additional cases. |
| Uncontrolled data used in path expression (`js/path-injection`) | More results | This query now recognizes additional file system calls. |
| Uncontrolled command line (`js/command-line-injection`) | More results | This query now recognizes additional command execution calls. |
| Expression has no effect (`js/useless-expression`) | Less results | This query no longer flags an expression when that expression is the only content of the containing file. |
| Unknown directive (`js/unknown-directive`) | Less results | This query no longer flags directives generated by the Babel compiler. |
| Code injection (`js/code-injection`) | More results | More potential vulnerabilities involving NoSQL code operators are now recognized. |
| Zip Slip (`js/zipslip`) | More results | This query now recognizes additional vulnerabilities. |

## Changes to libraries

* A library `semmle.javascript.explore.CallGraph` has been added to help write queries for exploring the call graph.
* Added data flow for `Map` and `Set`, and added matching type-tracking steps that can accessed using the `CollectionsTypeTracking` module.
