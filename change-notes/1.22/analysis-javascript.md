# Improvements to JavaScript analysis

## General improvements

* Support for the following frameworks and libraries has been improved:
  - [cross-spawn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-spawn)
  - [cross-spawn-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-spawn-async)
  - [exec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exec)
  - [execa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa)
  - [exec-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exec-async)
  - [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
  - [remote-exec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remote-exec)

* Support for tracking data flow and taint through getter functions (that is, functions that return a property of one of their arguments) and through the receiver object of method calls has been improved. This may produce more security alerts.
