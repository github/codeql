## New queries

| **Query**                                                                       | **Tags**                                                          | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


## Changes to existing queries

| **Query**                      | **Expected impact**          | **Change**                                                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Potentially unsafe external link (`js/unsafe-external-link`) | Fewer results | This query no longer flags URLs constructed using a template system where only the hash or query part of the URL is dynamic. |
| Incomplete URL substring sanitization (`js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`) | More results | This query now recognizes additional URLs when the substring check is an inclusion check. |
| Ambiguous HTML id attribute (`js/duplicate-html-id`) | Results no longer shown | Precision tag reduced to "low". The query is no longer run by default. |
| Unused loop iteration variable (`js/unused-loop-variable`) | Fewer results | This query no longer flags variables in a destructuring array assignment that are not the last variable in the destructed array. |
| Unsafe shell command constructed from library input (`js/shell-command-constructed-from-input`) | More results | This query now recognizes more commands where colon, dash, and underscore are used. |
| Unsafe jQuery plugin (`js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`) | More results | This query now detects more unsafe uses of nested option properties. |
| Client-side URL redirect (`js/client-side-unvalidated-url-redirection`) | More results | This query now recognizes some unsafe uses of `importScripts()` inside WebWorkers. |


## Changes to libraries
* The predicate `TypeAnnotation.hasQualifiedName` now works in more cases when the imported library was not present during extraction.
