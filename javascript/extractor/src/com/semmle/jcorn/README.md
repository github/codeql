This directory contains the source code of the JavaScript parser used by the JavaScript extractor, which is essentially a Java port of [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) and [acorn-jsx](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx) (both developed under an MIT license) with a few custom extensions.
