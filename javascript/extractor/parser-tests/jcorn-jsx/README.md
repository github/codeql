These tests were semi-automatically generated from the [acorn-jsx test suite](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx/tree/master/test).

For each test, `test<n>.js` is the input, `test<n>.options.json` are the parser options (if they are non-standard), `test<n>.ast` is the expected output pattern (if the test is meant to succeed), and `test<n>.fail` is the expected error message (if the test is meant to fail).
