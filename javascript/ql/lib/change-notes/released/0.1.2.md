## 0.1.2

### Deprecated APIs

* The `ReflectedXss`, `StoredXss`, `XssThroughDom`, and `ExceptionXss` modules from `Xss.qll` have been deprecated.  
  Use the `Customizations.qll` file belonging to the query instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The [cash](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/cash) library is now modelled as an alias for JQuery.  
  Sinks and sources from cash should now be handled by all XSS queries. 
* Added the `Selection` api as a DOM text source in the `js/xss-through-dom` query.
* The security queries now recognize drag and drop data as a source, enabling the queries to flag additional alerts.
* The security queries now recognize ClipboardEvent function parameters as a source, enabling the queries to flag additional alerts.
