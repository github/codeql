## 0.8.7

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted many deprecated predicates and classes with uppercase `CPU`, `TLD`, `SSA`, `ASM` etc. in their names. Use the PascalCased versions instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `getMessageSuffix` predicates in `CodeInjectionCustomizations.qll`.
* Deleted the deprecated `semmle/javascript/security/dataflow/ExternalAPIUsedWithUntrustedData.qll` file.
* Deleted the deprecated `getANonHtmlHeaderDefinition` and `nonHtmlContentTypeHeader` predicates from `ReflectedXssCustomizations.qll`.
* Deleted the deprecated `semmle/javascript/security/OverlyLargeRangeQuery.qll`, `semmle/javascript/security/regexp/ExponentialBackTracking.qll`, `semmle/javascript/security/regexp/NfaUtils.qll`, and `semmle/javascript/security/regexp/NfaUtils.qll` files.
* Deleted the deprecated `Expressions/TypoDatabase.qll` file.
* The diagnostic query `js/diagnostics/successfully-extracted-files`, and therefore the Code Scanning UI measure of scanned JavaScript and TypeScript files, now considers any JavaScript and TypeScript file seen during extraction, even one with some errors, to be extracted / scanned.
