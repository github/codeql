## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Additional heuristics for a new sensitive data classification for private information (e.g. credit card numbers) have been added to the shared `SensitiveDataHeuristics.qll` library. This may result in additional results for queries that use sensitive data such as `js/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data` and `js/clear-text-logging`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where very large TypeScript files would cause database creation to crash. Large files over 10MB were already excluded from analysis, but the file size check was not applied to TypeScript files.
