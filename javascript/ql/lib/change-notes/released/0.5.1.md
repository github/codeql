## 0.5.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted the deprecated `getPath` and `getFolder` predicates from the `XmlFile` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `getId` from the `Function`, `NamespaceDefinition`, and `ImportEqualsDeclaration` classes.
* Deleted the deprecated `flowsTo` predicate from the `HTTP::Servers::RequestSource` and `HTTP::Servers::ResponseSource` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `getEventName` predicate from the `SocketIO::ReceiveNode`, `SocketIO::SendNode`, `SocketIOClient::SendNode` classes.
* Deleted the deprecated `RateLimitedRouteHandlerExpr` and `RouteHandlerExpressionWithRateLimiter` classes.
* [Import assertions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions) are now supported.
  Previously this feature was only supported in TypeScript code, but is now supported for plain JavaScript as well and is also accessible in the AST.
