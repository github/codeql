## 2.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* Custom data flow queries will need to be migrated in order to use the shared data flow library. Until migrated, such queries will compile with deprecation warnings and run with a
  deprecated copy of the old data flow library. The deprecation layer will be removed in early 2026, after which any unmigrated queries will stop working.
  See more information in the [migration guide](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-language-guides/migrating-javascript-dataflow-queries).

### Major Analysis Improvements

* All data flow queries are now using the same underlying data flow library as the other languages analyses, replacing the old one written specifically for JavaScript/TypeScript.
  This is a significant change and users may consequently observe differences in the alerts generated by the analysis.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The sensitive data library has been improved so that `snake_case` style variable names are recognized more reliably. This may result in more sensitive data being identified, and more results from queries that use the sensitive data library.
