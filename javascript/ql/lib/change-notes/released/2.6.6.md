## 2.6.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Calls to `sinon.match()` are no longer incorrectly identified as regular expression operations.
* Improved data flow tracking through middleware to handle default value and similar patterns.
* Added `req._parsedUrl` as a remote input source.
* Improved taint tracking through calls to `serialize-javascript`.
* Removed `encodeURI` and `escape` functions from the sanitizer list for request forgery.
* The JavaScript extractor now skips generated JavaScript files if the original TypeScript files are already present. It also skips any files in the output directory specified in the `compilerOptions` part of the `tsconfig.json` file.
* Added support for Axios instances in the `axios` module.
