## 2.6.7

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Enhanced modeling for the `execa` library, adding support for command execution methods `execaCommand`, `execaCommandSync`, `$`, and `$.sync`, as well as file system operations through `inputFile`, `pipeStdout`, `pipeAll`, and `pipeStderr`.

### Bug Fixes

* The JavaScript extractor no longer ignores source files specified in the `tsconfig.json` compiler options `outDir` if doing so would result in excluding all source code.
