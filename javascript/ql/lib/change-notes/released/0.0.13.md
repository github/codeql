### Deprecated APIs

* Some predicates from `DefUse.qll`, `DataFlow.qll`, `TaintTracking.qll`, `DOM.qll`, `Definitions.qll` that weren't used by any query have been deprecated. 
  The documentation for each predicate points to an alternative.
* Many classes/predicates/modules that had upper-case acronyms have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.
* Some modules that started with a lowercase letter have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.
