## 0.4.0

### New Features

* Improved support for [Restify](http://restify.com/) framework, leading to more results when scanning applications developed with this framework.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted the deprecated `VHtmlSourceWrite` class from `DomBasedXssQuery.qll`.
* Deleted all the deprecated `[QueryName].qll` files from the `javascript/ql/lib/semmle/javascript/security/dataflow` folder, use the corresponding `[QueryName]Query.qll` files instead.
* The ReDoS libraries in `semmle.code.javascript.security.regexp` has been moved to a shared pack inside the `shared/` folder, and the previous location has been deprecated.
