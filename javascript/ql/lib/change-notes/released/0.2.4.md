## 0.2.4

### Deprecated APIs

* Many classes/predicates/modules with upper-case acronyms in their name have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.
* The utility files previously in the `semmle.javascript.security.performance` package have been moved to the `semmle.javascript.security.regexp` package.  
  The previous files still exist as deprecated aliases.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Most deprecated predicates/classes/modules that have been deprecated for over a year have been deleted.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed that top-level `for await` statements would produce a syntax error. These statements are now parsed correctly.
