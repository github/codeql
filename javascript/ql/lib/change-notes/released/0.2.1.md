## 0.2.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `chownr` library is now modeled as a sink for the `js/path-injection` query.
* Improved modeling of sensitive data sources, so common words like `certain` and `secretary` are no longer considered a certificate and a secret (respectively).
* The `gray-matter` library is now modeled as a sink for the `js/code-injection` query.
