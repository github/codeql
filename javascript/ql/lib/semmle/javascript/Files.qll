   *
   * The root prefix is of one of the following forms:
   *
   *   1. A single forward slash `/` (Unix-style)
   *   2. An upper-case drive letter followed by a colon and a forward slash,
   *      such as `C:/` (Windows-style)
   *   3. Two forward slashes, a computer name, and then another forward slash,
   *      such as `//FileServer/` (UNC-style)
   *
   * Path segments are never empty (that is, absolute paths never contain two
   * contiguous slashes, except as part of a UNC-style root prefix). Also, path
   * segments never contain forward slashes, and no path segment is of the
   * form `.` (one dot) or `..` (two dots).
   *
   * Note that an absolute path never ends with a forward slash, except if it is
   * a bare root prefix, that is, the path has no path segments. A container
   * whose absolute path has no segments is always a `Folder`, not a `File`.
