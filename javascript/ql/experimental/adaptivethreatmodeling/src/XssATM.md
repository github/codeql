# Client-side cross-site scripting (experimental)
Directly writing user input (for example, a URL query parameter) to a webpage without properly sanitizing the input first, allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

This kind of vulnerability is also called *DOM-based* cross-site scripting, to distinguish it from other types of cross-site scripting.

Note: This CodeQL query is an experimental query. Experimental queries generate alerts using machine learning. They might include more false positives but they will improve over time.


## Recommendation
To guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.


## Example
The following example shows part of the page URL being written directly to the document, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.


```javascript
function setLanguageOptions() {
    var href = document.location.href,
        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf("default=")+8);
    document.write("<OPTION value=1>"+deflt+"</OPTION>");
    document.write("<OPTION value=2>English</OPTION>");
}

```
