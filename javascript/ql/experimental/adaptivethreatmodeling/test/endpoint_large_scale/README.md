# autogenerated folder

This folder contains test data for the ATM endpoint CodeQL tests that has been autogenerated from the standard JS CodeQL libraries.

It is helpful, but not required, to periodically update this test data to incorporate new test data introduced in the standard JS CodeQL libraries.

To update this test data, run `python /path/to/codeql-lib/ql/javascript/test/update_endpoint_test_files.py`.

For more information view the source code of [`update_endpoint_test_files.py`](../../update_endpoint_test_files.py).
