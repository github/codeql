 * This query implements the analysis described in the following two papers:
 *
 *   James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: Static Analysis for
 *     Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attacks. NSS 2013.
 *     (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf)
 *   Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: Static Analysis for Regular Expression
 *     Exponential Runtime via Substructural Logics. 2014.
 *     (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/redos_full.pdf)
 *
 * The basic idea is to search for overlapping cycles in the NFA, that is,
 * states `q` such that there are two distinct paths from `q` to itself
 * that consume the same word `w`.
 *
 * For any such state `q`, an attack string can be constructed as follows:
 * concatenate a prefix `v` that takes the NFA to `q` with `n` copies of
 * the word `w` that leads back to `q` along two different paths, followed
 * by a suffix `x` that is _not_ accepted in state `q`. A backtracking
 * implementation will need to explore at least 2^n different ways of going
 * from `q` back to itself while trying to match the `n` copies of `w`
 * before finally giving up.
 *
 * Now in order to identify overlapping cycles, all we have to do is find
 * pumpable forks, that is, states `q` that can transition to two different
 * states `r1` and `r2` on the same input symbol `c`, such that there are
 * paths from both `r1` and `r2` to `q` that consume the same word. The latter
 * condition is equivalent to saying that `(q, q)` is reachable from `(r1, r2)`
 * in the product NFA.
 *
 * This is what the query does. It makes a simple attempt to construct a
 * prefix `v` leading into `q`, but only to improve the alert message.
 * And the query tries to prove the existence of a suffix that ensures
 * rejection. This check might fail, which can cause false positives.
 *
 * Finally, sometimes it depends on the translation whether the NFA generated
 * for a regular expression has a pumpable fork or not. We implement one
 * particular translation, which may result in false positives or negatives
 * relative to some particular JavaScript engine.
 *
 * More precisely, the query constructs an NFA from a regular expression `r`
 * as follows:
 *
 *   * Every sub-term `t` gives rise to an NFA state `Match(t,i)`, representing
 *     the state of the automaton before attempting to match the `i`th character in `t`.
 *   * There is one accepting state `Accept(r)`.
 *   * There is a special `AcceptAnySuffix(r)` state, which accepts any suffix string
 *     by using an epsilon transition to `Accept(r)` and an any transition to itself.
 *   * Transitions between states may be labelled with epsilon, or an abstract
 *     input symbol.
 *   * Each abstract input symbol represents a set of concrete input characters:
 *     either a single character, a set of characters represented by a
 *     character class, or the set of all characters.
 *   * The product automaton is constructed lazily, starting with pair states
 *     `(q, q)` where `q` is a fork, and proceding along an over-approximate
 *     step relation.
 *   * The over-approximate step relation allows transitions along pairs of
 *     abstract input symbols where the symbols have overlap in the characters they accept.
 *   * Once a trace of pairs of abstract input symbols that leads from a fork
 *     back to itself has been identified, we attempt to construct a concrete
 *     string corresponding to it, which may fail.
 *   * Lastly we ensure that any state reached by repeating `n` copies of `w` has
 *     a suffix `x` (possible empty) that is most likely __not__ accepted.
