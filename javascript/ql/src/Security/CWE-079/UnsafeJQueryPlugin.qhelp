		<p>

			Library plugins, such as those for the jQuery library, are often
			configurable through options provided by the clients of the
			plugin.


			Clients, however, do not know the implementation details
			of the plugin, so it is important to document the capabilities of each
			option.  The documentation for the plugin options that the client is
			responsible for sanitizing is of particular importance.

			Otherwise, the plugin may write user input (for example, a URL query
			parameter) to a web page without properly sanitizing it first,
			which allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the client
			application through dynamic HTML construction.

		</p>
	</overview>

	<recommendation>
		<p>

			Document all options that can lead to cross-site scripting
			attacks, and guard against unsafe inputs where dynamic HTML
			construction is not intended.

		</p>
	</recommendation>

	<example>
		<p>

			The following example shows a jQuery plugin that selects a
			DOM element, and copies its text content to another DOM element. The
			selection is performed by using the plugin option
			<code>sourceSelector</code> as a CSS selector.

		</p>

		<sample src="examples/UnsafeJQueryPlugin.js" />

		<p>

			This is, however, not a safe plugin, since the call to
			<code>jQuery</code> interprets <code>sourceSelector</code> as HTML if
			it is a string that starts with <code>&lt;</code>.

		</p>

		<p>

			Instead of documenting that the client is responsible for
			sanitizing <code>sourceSelector</code>, the plugin can use
			<code>jQuery.find</code> to always interpret
			<code>sourceSelector</code> as a CSS selector:
