<overview>
	<p>
		When a library function dynamically constructs HTML in a potentially unsafe
		way, then it's important to document to clients of the library that the function 
		should only be used with trusted inputs. 

		If the function is not documented as being potentially unsafe, then a client
		may inadvertently use inputs containing unsafe HTML fragments, and thereby leave
		the client vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.
	</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>

	<p>
		Document all library functions that can lead to cross-site scripting 
		attacks, and guard against unsafe inputs where dynamic HTML
		construction is not intended.
	</p>
</recommendation>
<example>

	<p>
		The following example has a library function that renders a boldface name
		by writing to the <code>innerHTML</code> property of an element.
	</p>

	<sample src="examples/unsafe-html-construction.js" />

	<p>
		This library function, however, does not escape unsafe HTML, and a client
		that calls the function with user-supplied input may be vulnerable to
		cross-site scripting attacks.
	</p>

	<p>
		The library could either document that this function should not be used
		with unsafe inputs, or use safe APIs such as <code>innerText</code>.
	</p>

	<sample src="examples/unsafe-html-construction_safe.js" />
	
	<p>
		Alternatively, a HTML sanitizer can be used to remove unsafe content.
	</p>
