	<overview>
		<p>
			Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection 
			can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). 
			Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content 
			into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute 
			arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
		</p>
	</overview>
	<recommendation>
		<p>
			Use a secure transfer protocol when downloading executables or other sensitive files.
		</p>
	</recommendation>
	<example>
		<p>
			In this example, a server downloads a shell script from a remote URL using the <code>node-fetch</code> 
			library, and then executes this shell script. 
		</p>
		<sample src="examples/insecure-download.js" />
		<p>
			The HTTP protocol is vulnerable to MITM, and thus an attacker could potentially replace the downloaded
			shell script with arbitrary code, which gives the attacker complete control over the system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The issue has been fixed in the example below by replacing the HTTP protocol with the HTTPS protocol.
