		<p>

			Many programmers mistakenly believe that information stored in
			cookies and hidden HTML form fields is tamper-proof and cannot be
			changed by the user. Hence they might try to verify other request data
			by comparing it against this information, for example by checking
			whether a user name embedded in a request parameter matches data
			stored in an (unsigned) cookie.

			In fact, however, all of these sources of data are user-controlled, so
			a malicious user can easily bypass such checks to gain unauthorized
			access to protected functionality or data.
