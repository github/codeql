<overview>
  <p>
    Most JavaScript objects inherit the properties of the built-in <code>Object.prototype</code> object.
    Prototype pollution is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker is able to modify <code>Object.prototype</code>.
    Since most objects inherit from the compromised <code>Object.prototype</code>, the attacker can use this
    to tamper with the application logic, and often escalate to remote code execution or cross-site scripting.
  </p>

  <p>
    One way to cause prototype pollution is through use of an unsafe <em>merge</em> or <em>extend</em> function
    to recursively copy properties from an untrusted source object.
    Such a call can modify any object reachable from the destination object, and
    the built-in <code>Object.prototype</code> is usually reachable through the special properties
    <code>__proto__</code> and <code>constructor.prototype</code>.
    An attacker can abuse this by sending an object with these property names and thereby modify <code>Object.prototype</code>.
  </p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
  <p>
    Update your library dependencies in order to use a safe version of the <em>merge</em> or <em>extend</em> function.
    If your library has no fixed version, switch to another library.
  </p>
</recommendation>

<example>
  <p>
    In the example below, the untrusted value <code>req.query.prefs</code> is parsed as JSON
    and then copied into a new object:
  </p>

  <sample src="examples/PrototypePollution1.js"/>

  <p>
    Prior to lodash 4.17.11 this would be vulnerable to prototype pollution. An attacker could send the following GET request:
  </p>

  <pre>GET /news?prefs={"constructor":{"prototype":{"xxx":true}}}</pre>

  <p>
    This causes the <code>xxx</code> property to be injected on <code>Object.prototype</code>.
    Fix this by updating the lodash version:
  </p>

  <sample src="examples/PrototypePollution_fixed.json"/>

  <p>
    Note that some web frameworks, such as Express, parse query parameters using extended URL-encoding
    by default.
    When this is the case, the application may be vulnerable even if not using <code>JSON.parse</code>.
    The example below would also be susceptible to prototype pollution:
  </p>

  <sample src="examples/PrototypePollution2.js"/>

  <p>
    In the above example, an attacker can cause prototype pollution by sending the following GET request:
  </p>

  <pre>GET /news?prefs[constructor][prototype][xxx]=true</pre>
</example>
