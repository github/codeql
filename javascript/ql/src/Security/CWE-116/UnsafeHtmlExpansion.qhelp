			Sanitizing untrusted input for HTML meta-characters is a
			common technique for preventing cross-site scripting attacks. But
			even a sanitized input can be dangerous to use if it is modified
			further before a browser treats it as HTML.

			A seemingly innocent transformation that expands a
			self-closing HTML tag from <code>&lt;div attr="{sanitized}"/&gt;</code>
			to <code>&lt;div attr="{sanitized}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> may
			in fact cause cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

		</p>
		
	</overview>

	<recommendation>
		<p>

			Use a well-tested sanitization library if at all
			possible, and avoid modifying sanitized values further before treating
			them as HTML.

		</p>

		<p>

			An even safer alternative is to design the application
			so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using HTML
			templates that are explicit about the values they treat as HTML.

		</p>

	</recommendation>

	<example>

		<p>

			The following function transforms a self-closing HTML tag
			to a pair of open/close tags.  It does so for all non-<code>img</code>
			and non-<code>area</code> tags, by using a regular expression with two
			capture groups. The first capture group corresponds to the name of the
			tag, and the second capture group to the content of the tag.

		</p>

		<sample src="examples/UnsafeHtmlExpansion.js" />

		<p>

			While it is generally known regular expressions are
			ill-suited for parsing HTML, variants of this particular transformation
			pattern have long been considered safe.

		</p>

		<p>

			However, the function is not safe. As an example, consider
			the following string:


		</p>

		<sample src="examples/UnsafeHtmlExpansion-original.html" />

		<p>

			When the above function transforms the string, it becomes
			a string that results in an alert when a browser treats it as HTML.

		</p>

		<sample src="examples/UnsafeHtmlExpansion-transformed.html" />
