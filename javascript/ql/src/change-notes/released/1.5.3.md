## 1.5.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data passed to the [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) constructor is now treated as a sink for `js/reflected-xss`.
* Slightly improved detection of DOM element references, leading to XSS results being detected in more cases.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug that would prevent extraction of `tsconfig.json` files when it contained an array literal with a trailing comma.
