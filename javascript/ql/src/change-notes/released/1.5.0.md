## 1.5.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Improved precision of data flow through arrays, fixing some spurious flows
  that would sometimes cause the `length` property of an array to be seen as tainted.
* Improved call resolution logic to better handle calls resolving "downwards", targeting
  a method declared in a subclass of the enclosing class. Data flow analysis
  has also improved to avoid spurious flow between unrelated classes in the class hierarchy.
