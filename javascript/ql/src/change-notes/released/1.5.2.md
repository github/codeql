## 1.5.2

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug, first introduced in `2.20.3`, that would prevent `v-html` attributes in Vue files
  from being flagged by the `js/xss` query. The original behaviour has been restored and the `v-html`
  attribute is once again functioning as a sink for the `js/xss` query.
* Fixed a bug that would in rare cases cause some regexp-based checks
  to be seen as generic taint sanitisers, even though the underlying regexp
  is not restrictive enough. The regexps are now analysed more precisely,
  and unrestrictive regexp checks will no longer block taint flow.
* Fixed a recently-introduced bug that caused `js/server-side-unvalidated-url-redirection` to ignore
  valid hostname checks and report spurious alerts after such a check. The original behaviour has been restored.
