## 0.6.2

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Added taint sources from the `@actions/core` and `@actions/github` packages.
* Added command-injection sinks from the `@actions/exec` package.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `js/indirect-command-line-injection` query no longer flags command arguments that cannot be interpreted as a shell string.
* The `js/unsafe-deserialization` query no longer flags deserialization through the `js-yaml` library, except
  when it is used with an unsafe schema.
* The Forge module in `CryptoLibraries.qll` now correctly classifies SHA-512/224,
  SHA-512/256, and SHA-512/384 hashes used in message digests as NonKeyCiphers.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a spurious diagnostic warning about comments in JSON files being illegal.
  Comments in JSON files are in fact fully supported, and the diagnostic message was misleading.
