## 0.1.0

### New Queries

* The `js/resource-exhaustion` query has been added. It highlights locations where an attacker can cause a large amount of resources to be consumed. 
  The query previously existed as an experimental query.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved handling of custom DOM elements, potentially leading to more alerts for the XSS queries.
* Improved taint tracking through calls to the `Array.prototype.reduce` function.
