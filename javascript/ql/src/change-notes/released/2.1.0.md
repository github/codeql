### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flow is now tracked through the `Promise.try` and `Array.prototype.with` functions.
* Query `js/index-out-of-bounds` no longer produces a false-positive when a strictly-less-than check overrides a previous less-than-or-equal test.
* The query `js/remote-property-injection` now detects property injection vulnerabilities through object enumeration patterns such as `Object.keys()`. 
* The query "Permissive CORS configuration" (`js/cors-permissive-configuration`) has been promoted from experimental and is now part of the default security suite. Thank you to @maikypedia who [submitted the original experimental query](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/14342)!
