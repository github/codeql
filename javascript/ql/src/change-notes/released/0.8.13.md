## 0.8.13

### Query Metadata Changes

* The `@precision` of the `js/unsafe-external-link` has been reduced to `low` to reflect the fact that modern browsers do not expose the opening window for such links. This mitigates the potential security risk of having a link with `target="_blank"`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The call graph has been improved, leading to more alerts for data flow based queries.
