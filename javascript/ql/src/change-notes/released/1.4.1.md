## 1.4.1

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a recently-introduced bug that prevented taint tracking through `URLSearchParams` objects.
  The original behaviour has been restored and taint should once again be tracked through such objects.
* Fixed a rare issue that would occur when a function declaration inside a block statement was referenced before it was declared.
  Such code is reliant on legacy web semantics, which is non-standard but nevertheless implemented by most engines.
  CodeQL now takes legacy web semantics into account and resolves references to these functions correctly.
* Fixed a bug that would cause parse errors in `.jsx` files in rare cases where the file
  contained syntax that was misinterpreted as Flow syntax.
