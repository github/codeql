## 0.6.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `DisablingCertificateValidation.ql` query has been updated to check `createServer` from `https` for disabled certificate validation.
* Improved the model of jQuery to account for XSS sinks where the HTML string
  is provided via a callback. This may lead to more results for the `js/xss` query.
* The `js/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query now flags cryptograhic operations using a weak block mode,
  such as AES-ECB.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where a destructuring pattern could not be parsed if it had a property
  named `get` or `set` with a default value.
