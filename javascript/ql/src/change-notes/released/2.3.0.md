## 2.3.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* JavaScript files with an average line length greater than 200 are now considered minified and will no longer be analyzed.
  For use-cases where minified files should be analyzed, the original behavior can be restored by setting the environment variable
  `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_JAVASCRIPT_ALLOW_MINIFIED_FILES=true`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The model of `vue-router` now properly detects taint sources in cases where
  the `props` property is a callback.
* Fixed a bug in the Next.js model that would cause the analysis to miss server-side taint sources in files
  named `route` or `page` appearing outside `api` and `pages` folders.
* `new Response(x)` is no longer seen as a reflected XSS sink when no `content-type` header
  is set, since the content type defaults to `text/plain`.
