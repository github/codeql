## 0.0.7

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Support for handlebars templates has improved. Raw interpolation tags of the form `{{& ... }}` are now recognized,
  as well as whitespace-trimming tags like `{{~ ... }}`.
* Data flow is now tracked across middleware functions in more cases, leading to more security results in general. Affected packages are `express` and `fastify`.
* `js/missing-token-validation` has been made more precise, yielding both fewer false positives and more true positives.
