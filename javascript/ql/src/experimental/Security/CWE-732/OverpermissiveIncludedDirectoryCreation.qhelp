<overview>

<p>Creating program directories world writable may allow an attacker to control program behavior by creating files in them.</p>

<p>This query finds directory creations with an insecure mode computed by including mode constants with bitwise or operations.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Construct a mode that does not grant world write permission. That means not including the constants <code>fs.constants.S_IWOTH</code> or <code>fs.constants.S_IRWXO</code>.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>This example creates a world writable configuration directory.</p>

<sample src="examples/OverpermissiveIncludedDirectoryCreationBad.js" />

<p>A secure replacement constructs a restricted mode for the created directory.</p>

<sample src="examples/OverpermissiveIncludedDirectoryCreationGood.js" />
