          <p>
               A JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for authenticating and managing users in an application.
          </p>
          <p>
               Only Decoding JWTs without checking if they have a valid signature or not can lead to security vulnerabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
               Don't use methods that only decode JWT, Instead use methods that verify the signature of JWT.
