<overview>
<p>
Duplicate scripts with identical or very similar contents indicate poorly structured
code that is hard to maintain. The artificially inflated amount of code hinders comprehension,
and ranges of similar but subtly different lines can mask the real purpose or intention behind
a function. Duplicate scripts can also suffer from update anomalies, where only one of several
copies of the code is updated to address a defect or add a feature, causing them to slowly
evolve apart.

<p>
Usually, script duplication can be addressed by removing all but one of the duplicates and
including the (now canonical) single remaining script wherever the other scripts were previously
used.
</p>

<p>
If the scripts are mostly, but not completely, identical, it is often possible to factor
out the common functionality into a new script. This improves reusability and resolves
the code duplication.
