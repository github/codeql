<overview>
<p>
The built-in <code>eval</code> function and the <code>Function</code> constructor allow executing 
arbitrary strings as JavaScript code. This is a dangerous feature, since this code has the same access
privileges as any other code, so great care has to be taken to ensure that malicious code is not
accidentally executed this way. Using this feature also hampers static checking and program comprehension.
In many cases, better alternatives are available and should be used instead.

<recommendation>

<p>
There are few genuine uses of <code>eval</code> and <code>Function</code>. If you are trying to
assign to a property whose name is not known until runtime, use a computed property access. If you
are trying to evaluate a string to a JSON object, use <code>JSON.parse</code>. In other cases,
you may be able to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern">Interpreter
pattern</a>.

<example>

<p>
In the following example, <code>eval</code> is used to define getter and setter methods for properties
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> on <code>Point.prototype</code>:

<p>
In a variant, the programmer has realized that they can use computed property accesses to avoid having
to wrap the assignment into an <code>eval</code>, although they still use the <code>Function</code>
constructor to create the accessor functions:
</p>

<sample src="examples/Eval2.js" />

<p>
This is not necessary either as the following example shows, where the use of <code>Function</code>
has also been replaced by computed property accesses:
