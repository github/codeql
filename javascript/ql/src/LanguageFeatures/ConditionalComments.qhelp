<p>
Conditional comments are only supported in Internet Explorer and should be avoided for portability.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>
Use feature detection (as offered by major frameworks such as <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>) instead.
</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>
The following code snippet uses conditional comments to detect whether it is running on Internet Explorer 9 or newer.
A better alternative would be to directly check for the desired features using, for instance, jQuery's
<code>$.support</code> object.

<p>
Note that conditional comments are no longer supported in Internet Explorer 11 Standards mode.
