<p>
The solution depends on the reason for the high number of lines:

<ul>

If the file contains one or more very large functions, you should decompose them into smaller

</li>

<li>
If the file contains many smaller functions, you should try to split up the file into multiple
smaller files.
</li>

<li>
If the file has been automatically generated by a tool, no changes are required because the file 
will not be maintained by a programmer.
</li>
</ul>
