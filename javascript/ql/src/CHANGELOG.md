## 0.0.11

### New Queries

* A new query, `js/functionality-from-untrusted-source`, has been added to the query suite. It finds DOM elements
  that load functionality from untrusted sources, like `script` or `iframe` elements using `http` links.
  The query is run by default.

### Query Metadata Changes

* The `js/request-forgery` query previously flagged both server-side and client-side request forgery,
  but these are now handled by two different queries:
  * `js/request-forgery` is now specific to server-side request forgery. Its precision has been raised to
    `high` and is now shown by default (it was previously in the `security-extended` suite).
  * `js/client-side-request-forgery` is specific to client-side request forgery. This is technically a new query
    but simply flags a subset of what the old query did.
    This has precision `medium` and is part of the `security-extended` suite.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added dataflow through the [`snapdragon`](https://npmjs.com/package/snapdragon) library.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Support for handlebars templates has improved. Raw interpolation tags of the form `{{& ... }}` are now recognized,
  as well as whitespace-trimming tags like `{{~ ... }}`.
* Data flow is now tracked across middleware functions in more cases, leading to more security results in general. Affected packages are `express` and `fastify`.
* `js/missing-token-validation` has been made more precise, yielding both fewer false positives and more true positives.

### Major Analysis Improvements

* TypeScript 4.5 is now supported.
