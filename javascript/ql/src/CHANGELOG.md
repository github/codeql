## 0.1.3

### New Queries

* The `js/actions/command-injection` query has been added. It highlights GitHub Actions workflows that may allow an 
  attacker to execute arbitrary code in the workflow.
  The query previously existed an experimental query.
* A new query `js/insecure-temporary-file` has been added. The query detects the creation of temporary files that may be accessible by others users. The query is not run by default. 

## 0.1.2

### New Queries

* The `js/missing-origin-check` query has been added. It highlights "message" event handlers that do not check the origin of the event.  
  The query previously existed as the experimental `js/missing-postmessageorigin-verification` query.

## 0.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The call graph now deals more precisely with calls to accessors (getters and setters).
  Previously, calls to static accessors were not resolved, and some method calls were
  incorrectly seen as calls to an accessor. Both issues have been fixed.

## 0.1.0

### New Queries

* The `js/resource-exhaustion` query has been added. It highlights locations where an attacker can cause a large amount of resources to be consumed. 
  The query previously existed as an experimental query.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved handling of custom DOM elements, potentially leading to more alerts for the XSS queries.
* Improved taint tracking through calls to the `Array.prototype.reduce` function.

## 0.0.14

## 0.0.13

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed an issue that would sometimes prevent the data-flow analysis from finding flow
  paths through a function that stores its result on an object.
  This may lead to more results for the security queries.

## 0.0.12

## 0.0.11

### New Queries

* A new query, `js/functionality-from-untrusted-source`, has been added to the query suite. It finds DOM elements
  that load functionality from untrusted sources, like `script` or `iframe` elements using `http` links.
  The query is run by default.

### Query Metadata Changes

* The `js/request-forgery` query previously flagged both server-side and client-side request forgery,
  but these are now handled by two different queries:
  * `js/request-forgery` is now specific to server-side request forgery. Its precision has been raised to
    `high` and is now shown by default (it was previously in the `security-extended` suite).
  * `js/client-side-request-forgery` is specific to client-side request forgery. This is technically a new query
    but simply flags a subset of what the old query did.
    This has precision `medium` and is part of the `security-extended` suite.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added dataflow through the [`snapdragon`](https://npmjs.com/package/snapdragon) library.

## 0.0.10

### New Queries

* A new query, `js/unsafe-code-construction`, has been added to the query suite, highlighting libraries that may leave clients vulnerable to arbitary code execution.
  The query is not run by default.
* A new query `js/file-system-race` has been added. The query detects when there is time between a file being checked and used. The query is not run by default.
* A new query `js/jwt-missing-verification` has been added. The query detects applications that don't verify JWT tokens.
* The `js/insecure-dependency` query has been added. It detects depedencies that are downloaded using an unencrypted connection.

## 0.0.9

### New Queries

* A new query `js/samesite-none-cookie` has been added. The query detects when the SameSite attribute is set to None on a sensitive cookie.
* A new query `js/empty-password-in-configuration-file` has been added. The query detects empty passwords in configuration files. The query is not run by default.

## 0.0.8

## 0.0.7

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Support for handlebars templates has improved. Raw interpolation tags of the form `{{& ... }}` are now recognized,
  as well as whitespace-trimming tags like `{{~ ... }}`.
* Data flow is now tracked across middleware functions in more cases, leading to more security results in general. Affected packages are `express` and `fastify`.
* `js/missing-token-validation` has been made more precise, yielding both fewer false positives and more true positives.

## 0.0.6

### Major Analysis Improvements

* TypeScript 4.5 is now supported.

## 0.0.5

### New Queries

* The `js/sensitive-get-query` query has been added. It highlights GET requests that read sensitive information from the query string.
* The `js/insufficient-key-size` query has been added. It highlights the creation of cryptographic keys with a short key size.
* The `js/session-fixation` query has been added. It highlights servers that reuse a session after a user has logged in.
