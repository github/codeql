Customizing the JavaScript analysis
===================================

This document describes the main extension points offered by the JavaScript analysis for customizing
analysis behavior without editing the queries or libraries themselves.

Customization mechanisms
------------------------

The two mechanisms used for customization are subclassing and overriding.

We can teach the JavaScript analysis to handle further instances of abstract concepts it already
understands by subclassing abstract classes and implementing their member predicates. For example,
the standard library defines an abstract class ``SystemCommandExecution`` that covers various APIs
for executing operating-system commands. This class is used by the command-injection analysis to
identify problematic flows where input from a potentially malicious user is interpreted as the name
of a system command to execute. By defining additional subclasses of ``SystemCommandExecution``, we
can make this analysis more powerful without touching its implementation.

By overriding a member predicate defined in the library, we can change its behavior either for all
its receivers or only a subset. For example, the standard library predicate
``ControlFlowNode::getASuccessor`` implements the basic control-flow graph on which many further
analyses are based. By overriding it, we can add, suppress, or modify control-flow graph edges.

Once a customization has been defined, it needs to be brought into scope so that the default
analysis queries pick it up. This can be done by adding the customizing definitions to
``Customizations.qll``, an initially empty library file that is imported by the default library
``javascript.qll``.

Sometimes you may want to perform both kinds of customizations at the same time. That is, subclass a base
class to provide new implementations of an API, and override some member predicates of the same base
class to selectively change the implementation of the API. This is not always easy to do, since the
former requires the base class to be abstract, while the latter requires it to be concrete.

To work around this, the JavaScript library uses the so-called *range pattern*. In this pattern, the base class
``Base`` itself is concrete, but it has an abstract companion class called ``Base::Range`` covering
the same set of values. To change the implementation of the API, subclass ``Base`` and override its
member predicates. To provide new implementations of the API, subclass ``Base::Range`` and implement
its abstract member predicates.

For example, the class ``Base64::Encode`` in the standard library models base64-encoding libraries
using the range pattern.  It comes with subclasses corresponding to many popular base64 encoders. To
add support for a new library, subclass ``Base64::Encode::Range`` and implement the member
predicates ``getInput`` and ``getOutput``. To customize the definition of ``getInput`` or
``getOutput`` for a library that is already supported, extend ``Base64::Encode`` itself and override
the predicate you want to customize.

Note that currently the range pattern is not used everywhere yet, so you will find some abstract
classes without a concrete companion. We are planning on eventually migrating most abstract classes
to use the range pattern.

Analysis layers
---------------

The JavaScript analysis libraries have a layered structure with higher-level analyses based on
lower-level ones. Usually, classes and predicates in a lower layer should not depend on a higher
layer to avoid performance problems and non-monotonic recursion.

In this section, we briefly introduce the most important analysis layers, starting from the lowest
layer. Below, we discuss the extension points offered by the individual layers.

Abstract syntax tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The abstract syntax tree (AST), implemented by class ``ASTNode`` and its subclasses, is the lowest layer
and is a good representation of the information stored in the snapshot database. It
corresponds closely to the syntactic structure of the program, only abstracting away from
typographical details such as whitespace and indentation.

Control-flow graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (intra-procedural) control-flow graph (CFG), implemented by class ``ControlFlowNode`` and its
subclasses, is the next layer. It models flow of control inside functions and top-level scripts. The
CFG is overlaid on top of the AST, meaning that each AST node has a corresponding CFG node. There
are also synthetic CFG nodes that do not correspond to an AST node. For example, entry and exit
nodes (``ControlFlowEntryNode`` and ``ControlFlowExitNode``) mark the beginning and end,
respectively, of the execution of a function or top-level script, while guard nodes
(``GuardControlFlowNode``) record that some condition is known to hold at some point in the program.

Basic blocks (class ``BasicBlock``) organize control-flow nodes into maximal sequences of
straight-line code, which is vital for efficiently reasoning about control flow.

Static single-assignment form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The static single-assignment (SSA) representation (class ``SsaVariable`` and ``SsaDefinition``) uses
control-flow information to split up local variables into SSA variables that each only have a single
definition.

In addition to regular definitions corresponding to assignments and increment/decrement expressions,
the SSA form also introduces pseudo-definitions such as

  - *phi nodes*, where multiple possible values for a variable are merged
  - *refinement nodes* (also known as *pi nodes*) marking program points where additional information about a variable becomes available that may restrict its possible set of values.

Local data flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (intra-procedural) data-flow graph, implemented by class ``DataFlow::Node`` and its subclasses,
represents the flow of data within a function or top-level scripts. Each expression has a
corresponding data-flow node. Additionally, there are data-flow nodes that do not correspond to
syntactic elements. For example, each SSA variable has a corresponding data-flow node. Note that
flow between functions (through arguments and return values) is not modeled in this layer, except
for the special case of immediately-invoked function expressions. Flow through object properties is
also not modeled.

This layer also implements the widely-used source-node API. The class ``DataFlow::SourceNode`` and its
subclasses represent data-flow nodes where new objects are created (such as object expressions), or
where non-local data flow enters the intra-procedural data-flow graph (such as function parameters
or property reads). The source-node API provides convenient predicates for reasoning about these
nodes without having to explicitly encode data-flow graph traversal.

Type inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class ``AnalyzedNode`` and its subclasses implement (intra-procedural) type inference on top of the
local data-flow graph. Some reasoning about properties is implemented as well, but more advanced
features such as the prototype chain are not considered.

Call graph
~~~~~~~~~~

The call graph is implemented as a predicate ``getACallee`` on ``DataFlow::InvokeNode``, the class
of data-flow nodes representing function calls (with or without ``new``). It uses local data flow and
type information, as well as type annotations where available.

Type tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The type-tracking framework (classes ``DataFlow::TypeTracker`` and ``DataFlow::TypeBackTracker``) is
a library for implementing custom type inference systems that track values inter-procedurally,
including tracking through one level of object properties.

Framework models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The libraries under ``semmle/javascript/frameworks`` model a broad range of popular JavaScript
libraries and frameworks, such as Express and Vue.js. Some framework modeling libraries are located
under ``semmle/javascript`` directly, for instance ``Base64``, ``EmailClients``, and ``JsonParsers``.

Global data flow and taint tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inter-procedural data flow and taint-tracking libraries can be used to implement static
information-flow analyses. Most of our security queries are based on this approach.

Extension points
----------------

In this section, we discuss the most important extension points for the individual analysis layers introduced
above.

AST
~~~

This layer should not normally be customized. It is technically possible to override, for instance,
``ASTNode.getChild`` to change the way the AST structure is represented, but this should normally be
avoided in the interest of keeping a close correspondence between AST and concrete syntax.

CFG
~~~

You can override ``ControlFlowNode.getASuccessor`` to customize the control-flow graph. Note that
overriding ``ControlFlowNode.getAPredecessor`` is not normally useful, since it is rarely used in
higher-level libraries.

SSA
~~~

It is not normally necessary to customize this layer.

Local data flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DataFlow::SourceNode`` class uses the range pattern, so new kinds of source nodes can be
added by extending ``Dataflow::SourceNode::Range``. Some of its subclasses can similarly be
extended. For example, ``DataFlow::ModuleImportNode`` models module imports, and ``DataFlow::ClassNode`` models
class definitions. The former provides default implementations covering CommonJS, AMD, and ECMAScript
2015 modules, while the latter handles ECMAScript 2015 classes, as well as traditional function-based
classes.Â You can extend their corresponding ``::Range`` classes to add support for other module or
class systems.

Type inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can override ``AnalyzedNode::getAValue`` to customize the type inference. Note that the type
inference is expected to be sound, that is (as far as practical), the abstract values inferred for a
data-flow node should cover all possible concrete values this node may take on at runtime.

You can also extend the set of abstract values. To add individual abstract values that are
independent of the program being analyzed, define a subclass of ``CustomAbstractValueTag``
describing the new abstract value. There will then be a corresponding value of class
``CustomAbstractValue`` that you can use in overriding definitions of the ``getAValue`` predicate.

Call graph
~~~~~~~~~~

You can override ``DataFlow::InvokeNode::getACallee(int)`` to customize the call graph. Note that
overriding the zero-argument version ``getACallee()`` is not enough, since higher layers use the
one-argument version.

Type tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not normally necessary to customize this layer.

Framework models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``semmle.javascript.frameworks.HTTP`` module defines many abstract classes that can be extended
to implement support for new web server frameworks. These classes, in turn, are used by some of the
security queries (such as the reflected cross-site scripting query) to define sources and sinks, so
these queries will automatically benefit from the additional modeling.

Similarly, the ``semmle.javascript.frameworks.ClientRequests`` module defines an abstract class for
modeling client-side HTTP requests. It comes with built-in support for a number of popular
frameworks, and you can add support for new frameworks by extending the abstract class.

The ``semmle.javascript.frameworks.SQL`` module defines abstract classes for modeling SQL
connector libraries, and the ``semmle.javascript.JsonParsers`` and
``semmle.javascript.frameworks.XML`` modules for modeling JSON and XML parsers, respectively.

The ``semmle.javascript.Concepts`` module defines a small number of broad concepts such as system-command
executions or file-system accesses, which are concretely instantiated in some of the existing
framework libraries, but can of course be further extended to model additional frameworks.

Global data flow and taint tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most security queries consist of:

  - one QL file defining the query
  - one configuration module defining the taint-tracking configuration
  - one customization module defining sources, sinks, and sanitizers

For example, ``Security/CWE-078/CommandInjection.ql`` defines the command-injection query. It
imports the module ``semmle.javascript.security.dataflow.CommandInjection``, which defines the
configuration class ``CommandInjection::Configuration``. This module in turn imports
``semmle.javascript.security.dataflow.CommandInjectionCustomizations``, which defines three abstract
classes (``CommandInjection::Source``, ``CommandInjection::Sink``, and
``CommandInjection::Sanitizer``) that model sources, sinks, and sanitizers, respectively.

To define additional sources, sinks or sanitizers for this or any other security query, import the
customization module and extend these abstract classes with additional subclasses.

Note that for performance reasons you should normally only import the configuration module from a QL
file. Importing it into the standard library (for example by importing it in ``Customizations.qll``)
will slow down all the other security queries, since the configuration class will now be always in
scope and flow from its sources to sinks will be tracked in addition to all the other configuration
classes.

Another useful extension point is the class ``RemoteFlowSource``, which is used as a source by most
queries looking for injection vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting). By
extending it with new subclasses modelling other sources of user-controlled input you can
simultaneously improve all of these queries.
