<overview>
<p> A global (module-level) variable is defined (by an assignment) but never used
and is not explicitly made public by inclusion in the <code>__all__</code> list.
</p>

<include src="UnusedVariableNaming.inc.qhelp" />
<include src="UnusedTuple.inc.qhelp" />

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>If the variable is included for documentation purposes or is otherwise intentionally unused, then change its name to indicate that it is unused,
otherwise delete the assignment (taking care not to delete right hand side if it has side effects).</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<p>In this example, the <code>random_no</code> variable is never read but its assignment
has a side effect. Because of this it is important to only remove the left hand side of the
assignment in line 9.</p>
