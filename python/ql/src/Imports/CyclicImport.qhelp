<overview>
<p>A cyclic import is an <code>import</code> which imports another module
and that module imports (possibly indirectly) the module which contains the
<code>import</code> statement.</p>

<p>Cyclic imports indicate that two modules are circularly dependent. This means
that the modules cannot be tested independently, and it makes it harder to
understand the architecture of the system.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>The cycle may be broken by removing any one import. If only one function or
method requires the import, then consider moving that to the other module and
deleting the import. If the two modules are more intimately connected, then move
the inter-dependent parts into a third module and have both the original modules
import that.
