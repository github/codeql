        <p>Security checks bypass due to a Unicode transformation</p>
        <p> If security checks or logical validation is performed before unicode normalization, the
            security checks or logical validation could be bypassed due to a potential Unicode
            character collision. The validation we consider are: any character escaping, any regex
            validation, or any string manipulation (such as <code>str.split</code>). </p>
    </overview>
    <recommendation>
        <p> Perform Unicode normalization before the logical validation. </p>
    </recommendation>
    <example>

        <p> The following example showcases the bypass of all checks performed by <code>
            flask.escape()</code> due to a post-unicode normalization.</p>
        <p>For instance: the character U+FE64 (<code>ï¹¤</code>) is not filtered-out by the flask
            escape function. But due to the Unicode normalization, the character is transformed and
            would become U+003C (<code> &lt; </code> ).</p>
