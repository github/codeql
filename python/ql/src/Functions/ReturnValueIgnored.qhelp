<overview>
<p>When a function returns a non-trivial value, that value should not be ignored. Doing so may result in errors being ignored or
information being thrown away.</p>

<p>A return value is considered to be trivial if it is <code>None</code> or it is a parameter (parameters, usually <code>self</code> are often
returned to assist with method chaining, but can be ignored).
A return value is also assumed to be trivial if it is ignored for more than 25% of calls.
</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Act upon all non-trivial return values, either propagating each value or recording it.
If a return value should be ignored, then ensure that it is ignored consistently.
</p>
    
<p>
If you have access to the source code of the called function, then consider modifying it so that it does not return pointless values.

<example>

<p>
In the <code>ignore_error</code> function the error condition is ignored.
Ideally the <code>Resource.initialize()</code> function would raise an exception if it failed, but as it does not, the caller must deal with the error.
The <code>do_not_ignore_error</code> function checks the error condition and raises an exception if <code>Resource.initialize()</code> fails.
