   * path, which are essentially indistinguishable for a client of the API.

   * On the other hand, a single node can have multiple access paths (which is, of
   * course, unavoidable). We pick as canonical the alphabetically least access path with

     * Modeling imports is slightly tricky because of the way we handle dotted name imports in our

     * ```python
     * import foo.bar.baz as fbb
     * from foo.bar.baz import quux as fbbq
     * ```
     *
     * the dotted name is simply represented as a string. We would like `fbb.quux` and `fbbq` to

     *
     * ```ql
     * moduleImport("foo").getMember("bar").getMember("baz").getMember("quux")
     * ```
     *
     * To do this, we produce an API graph node for each dotted name prefix we find in the set of
     * imports. Thus, for the above two imports, we would get nodes for
     *
     * ```python
     * foo
     * foo.bar
     * foo.bar.baz
     * ```
     *
     * Only the first of these can act as the beginning of a path (and become a
     * `moduleImport`-labeled edge from the global root node).
     *
     * (Using prefixes rather than simply `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` is important. We don't want
     * potential crosstalk between `foo.bar.baz` and `ham.bar.eggs`.)
     *
     * We then add `getMember` edges between these prefixes: `foo` steps to `foo.bar` via an edge
     * labeled `getMember("bar")` and so on.
     *
     * When we then see `import foo.bar.baz as fbb`, the data-flow node `fbb` gets marked as a use
     * of the API graph node corresponding to the prefix `foo.bar.baz`. Because of the edges leading to
     * this node, it is reachable via `moduleImport("foo").getMember("bar").getMember("baz")` and
     * thus `fbb.quux` is reachable via the path mentioned above.
     *
     * When we see `from foo.bar.baz import quux as fbbq` a similar thing happens. First, `foo.bar.baz`
     * is seen as a use of the API graph node as before. Then `import quux as fbbq` is seen as
     * a member lookup of `quux` on the API graph node for `foo.bar.baz`, and then finally the
     * data-flow node `fbbq` is marked as a use of the same path mentioned above.
     *
     * Finally, in a non-aliased import such as
     *
     * ```python
     * import foo.bar.baz
     * ```
     *
     * we only consider this as a definition of the name `foo` (thus making it a use of the corresponding
     * API graph node for the prefix `foo`), in accordance with the usual semantics of Python.
