/**
 * Configuration to determine the state of a context being used to create
 * a connection. There is one configuration for each pair of `TlsLibrary` and `ProtocolVersion`,
 * such that a single configuration only tracks contexts where a specific `ProtocolVersion` is allowed.
 *
 * The state is in terms of whether a specific protocol is allowed. This is
 * either true or false when the context is created and can then be modified
 * later by either restricting or unrestricting the protocol (see the predicates
 * `isRestriction` and `isUnrestriction`).
 *
 * Since we are interested in the final state, we want the flow to start from
 * the last unrestriction, so we disallow flow into unrestrictions. We also
 * model the creation as an unrestriction of everything it allows, to account
 * for the common case where the creation plays the role of "last unrestriction".
 *
 * Since we really want "the last unrestriction, not nullified by a restriction",
 * we also disallow flow into restrictions.
