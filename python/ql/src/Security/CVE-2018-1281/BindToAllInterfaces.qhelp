<overview>
<p>One binds a socket to a given address and a given port
to make it possible to receive data on this particular socket.
Alternatively, this can also be done to use the (IP address, port) pair
as the source of the data being sent.
To bind a socket to all available IPv4 addresses
when using the built-in Python <code>socket</code> module
(for instance, when building a message sender service
or an FTP server data transmitter),
one can specify <code>0.0.0.0</code> as the IP address.
When you bind the port to all interfaces,
you essentially allow to accept connections from any IPv4 address
provided that it can get to the socket via routing.
Binding to all interfaces is therefore associated with security risks.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>Bind your service incoming traffic only to a dedicated interface.
If you think you would need to bind more than one interface
(instead of binding to all) using the built-in <code>socket</code> module,
you would need to create multiple sockets.</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>In this example, two sockets are bound to all interfaces;
one through the <code>0.0.0.0</code> notation
and another one through an empty string <code>''</code>.
