<overview>
<p>
Modern encryption relies on it being computationally infeasible to break the cipher and decode a message without the key.
As computational power increases, the ability to break ciphers grows and keys need to become larger.
</p>
<p>
The three main asymmetric key algorithms currently in use are Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cryptography, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC).
With current technology, key sizes of 2048 bits for RSA and DSA,
or 256 bits for ECC, are regarded as unbreakable.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Increase the key size to the recommended amount or larger. For RSA or DSA this is at least 2048 bits, for ECC this is at least 256 bits.
