<overview>
<p>Python, unlike statically typed languages such as Java, allows complete freedom when calling methods during object destruction.
However, standard object-oriented principles apply to Python classes using deep inheritance hierarchies.
Therefore the developer has responsibility for ensuring that objects are properly cleaned up when
there are multiple <code>__del__</code> methods that need to be called.
</p>

<p>
Calling a <code>__del__</code> method more than once during object destruction risks resources being released multiple
times. The relevant <code>__del__</code> method may not be designed to be called more than once.
</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that a <code>__del__</code> method may be be called more than once.</p>
<ul>
    <li>There may be more than one explicit call to the method in the hierarchy of <code>__del__</code> methods.</li>
    <li>A class using multiple inheritance directly calls the <code>__del__</code> methods of its base types.
    One or more of those base types uses <code>super()</code> to pass down the inheritance chain.</li>
</ul>


</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Either be careful not to explicitly call a <code>__del__</code> method more than once, or
use <code>super()</code> throughout the inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Alternatively refactor one or more of the classes to use composition rather than inheritance.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<p>In the first example, explicit calls to <code>__del__</code> are used, but <code>SportsCar</code> erroneously calls
both <code>Vehicle.__del__</code> and <code>Car.__del__</code>.
This can be fixed by removing the call to <code>Vehicle.__del__</code>, as shown in <code>FixedSportsCar</code>.
</p>

<p>In the second example, there is a mixture of explicit calls to <code>__del__</code> and calls using <code>super()</code>.
To fix this example, <code>super()</code> should be used throughout.
