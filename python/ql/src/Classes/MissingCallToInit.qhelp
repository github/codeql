<overview>
<p>Python, unlike statically typed languages such as Java, allows complete freedom when calling methods during object initialization.
However, standard object-oriented principles apply to Python classes using deep inheritance hierarchies.
Therefore the developer has responsibility for ensuring that objects are properly initialized when
there are multiple <code>__init__</code> methods that need to be called.
</p>
<p>
If the  <code>__init__</code> method of a superclass is not called during object initialization it is likely that
that object will end up in an incorrect state.
</p>

<p>A call to the <code>__init__</code> method of a superclass during object initialization may be omitted:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>When a subclass calls the <code>__init__</code> method of the wrong class.</li>
        <li>When a call to the <code>__init__</code> method of one its base classes is omitted.</li>
        <li>When multiple inheritance is used and a class inherits from several base classes,
        and at least one of those does not use <code>super()</code> in its own <code>__init__</code> method.</li>
</ul>


</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Either be careful to explicitly call the <code>__init__</code> of the correct base class, or
use <code>super()</code> throughout the inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Alternatively refactor one or more of the classes to use composition rather than inheritance.</p>


</recommendation>
<example>
<p>In this example, explicit calls to <code>__init__</code> are used, but <code>SportsCar</code> erroneously calls
<code>Vehicle.__init__</code>. This is fixed in <code>FixedSportsCar</code> by calling <code>Car.__init__</code>.
