## 1.4.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

- The `py/special-method-wrong-signature` has been modernized and rewritten to no longer rely on outdated APIs. Moreover, the query no longer flags cases where a default value is never used, as these alerts were rarely useful.

### Bug Fixes

- The `py/unused-global-variable` now no longer flags variables that are only used in forward references (e.g. the `Foo` in `def bar(x: "Foo"): ...`).
