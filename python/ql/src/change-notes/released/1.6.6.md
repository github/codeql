## 1.6.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

- The queries that check for unmatchable `$` and `^` in regular expressions did not account correctly for occurrences inside lookahead and lookbehind assertions. These occurrences are now handled correctly, eliminating this source of false positives.
* The `py/inheritance/signature-mismatch` query has been modernized. It produces more precise results and more descriptive alert messages. 
* The `py/inheritance/incorrect-overriding-signature` query has been deprecated. Its results have been consolidated into the `py/inheritance/signature-mismatch` query.
