## 0.5.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added model of `cx_Oracle`, `oracledb`, `phonenixdb` and `pyodbc` PyPI packages as a SQL interface following PEP249, resulting in additional sinks for `py/sql-injection`.
* Added model of `executemany` calls on PEP-249 compliant database APIs, resulting in additional sinks for `py/sql-injection`.
* Added model of `pymssql` PyPI package as a SQL interface following PEP249, resulting in additional sinks for `py/sql-injection`.
* The alert messages of many queries were changed to better follow the style guide and make the messages consistent with other languages.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed how `flask.request` is modeled as a RemoteFlowSource, such that we show fewer duplicated alert messages for Code Scanning alerts. The import, such as `from flask import request`, will now be shown as the first step in a path explanation.
