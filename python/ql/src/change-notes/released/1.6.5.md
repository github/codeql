## 1.6.5

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The queries `py/missing-call-to-init`, `py/missing-calls-to-del`, `py/multiple-calls-to-init`, and `py/multiple-calls-to-del` queries have been modernized; no longer relying on outdated libraries, producing more precise results with more descriptive alert messages, and improved documentation.
