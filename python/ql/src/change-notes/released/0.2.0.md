## 0.2.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Improved library modeling for the query "Request without certificate validation" (`py/request-without-cert-validation`), so it now also covers `httpx`, `aiohttp.client`, and `urllib3`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm" (`py/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`) now reports if a cryptographic operation is potentially insecure due to use of a weak block mode.
