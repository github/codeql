## 1.6.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `py/unexpected-raise-in-special-method` query has been modernized. It produces additional results in cases where the exception is 
only raised conditionally. Its precision has been changed from `very-high` to `high`.
* The queries `py/incomplete-ordering`, `py/inconsistent-equality`, and `py/equals-hash-mismatch` have been modernized; no longer relying on outdated libraries, improved documentation, and no longer producing alerts for problems specific to Python 2.
