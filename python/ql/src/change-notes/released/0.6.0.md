## 0.6.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `analysis/AlertSuppression.ql` query has moved to the root folder. Users that refer to this query by path should update their configurations. The query has been updated to support the new `# codeql[query-id]` supression comments. These comments can be used to suppress an alert and must be placed on a blank line before the alert. In addition the legacy `# lgtm` and `# lgtm[query-id]` comments can now also be placed on the line before an alert.
* Bumped the minimum keysize we consider secure for elliptic curve cryptography from 224 to 256 bits, following current best practices. This might effect results from the _Use of weak cryptographic key_ (`py/weak-crypto-key`) query.
* Added modeling of `getpass.getpass` as a source of passwords, which will be an additional source for `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`, `py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`, and `py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`.
