# User-defined methods, both instance methods and class methods, can be called in many non-standard ways
# i.e. differently from simply `c.f()` or `C.f()`. For example, a user-defined `__await__` method on a
# class `C` will be called by the syntactic construct `await c` when `c` is an instance of `C`.
#
# These tests are based on the first part of https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html.
# A thorough covering of methods in that document is found in classes.py.
#
# Intended sources should be the variable `SOURCE` and intended sinks should be
# arguments to the function `SINK` (see python/ql/test/experimental/dataflow/testConfig.qll).

# Generator functions
# A function or method which uses the yield statement (see section The yield statement) is called a generator function. Such a function, when called, always returns an iterator object which can be used to execute the body of the function: calling the iterator’s iterator.__next__() method will cause the function to execute until it provides a value using the yield statement. When the function executes a return statement or falls off the end, a StopIteration exception is raised and the iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be returned.

# Coroutine functions
# A function or method which is defined using async def is called a coroutine function. Such a function, when called, returns a coroutine object. It may contain await expressions, as well as async with and async for statements. See also the Coroutine Objects section.
async def coro(x):

    return (yield from asyncio.coroutine(lambda: SOURCE)())

async def agen(x):
  a = A()
  return await a

SINK(asyncio.run(agen(SOURCE))) # $ MISSING: flow

# Asynchronous generator functions
# A function or method which is defined using async def and which uses the yield statement is called a asynchronous generator function. Such a function, when called, returns an asynchronous iterator object which can be used in an async for statement to execute the body of the function.

# Calling the asynchronous iterator’s aiterator.__anext__() method will return an awaitable which when awaited will execute until it provides a value using the yield expression. When the function executes an empty return statement or falls off the end, a StopAsyncIteration exception is raised and the asynchronous iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be yielded.

# Built-in functions
# A built-in function object is a wrapper around a C function. Examples of built-in functions are len() and math.sin() (math is a standard built-in module). The number and type of the arguments are determined by the C function. Special read-only attributes: __doc__ is the function’s documentation string, or None if unavailable; __name__ is the function’s name; __self__ is set to None (but see the next item); __module__ is the name of the module the function was defined in or None if unavailable.

# Built-in methods
# This is really a different disguise of a built-in function, this time containing an object passed to the C function as an implicit extra argument. An example of a built-in method is alist.append(), assuming alist is a list object. In this case, the special read-only attribute __self__ is set to the object denoted by alist.

# Classes
# Classes are callable. These objects normally act as factories for new instances of themselves, but variations are possible for class types that override __new__(). The arguments of the call are passed to __new__() and, in the typical case, to __init__() to initialize the new instance.

# Class Instances
# Instances of arbitrary classes can be made callable by defining a __call__() method in their class.

# If a class sets __iter__() to None, calling iter() on its instances will raise a TypeError (without falling back to __getitem__()).
