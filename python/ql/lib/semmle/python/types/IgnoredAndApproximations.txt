List of approximations used and semantic details that are ignored
=================================================================

1. Metaclass __getattribute___

Attribute lookup on a class, but not its instances, used the __getattribute__()
method of the metaclass. I doubt anyone every overrides this method except for debugging 
or testing frameworks, so we ignore the possibility that for a class C
(type(C)).__getattribute__ != type.__getattribute__

2. Class __getattribute__
Many analyses are context-insensitive. For those analyses any instance of a class that
defines  __getattribute__ are treated as having unknowable attributes.

3. Class and Function descriptors
Class and Function descriptors provide a challenge. 
The resulting entity is the result of calling the descriptor with the function as input:
@dec
def f(): pass
is equivalent to f = dec(f)
 
and decorators themselves can be the result of calling a higher-order function
and can, also be themselves decorated.

This clearly requires context sensitive analysis.
@dec(x):
def f(): pass
is equivalent to f = dec(x)(f)
but in a context-insensitive context.
Need a method:
Object decoratored_function(Object decorator, Object undecorated);
But what is the decorator and what object is available as a result?
Need to create an object for each decorator of a class or function.
That should be the actual Object.

There is an assumption that each Object has a one-to-one mapping with a FlowNode
adding extra Objects for decorators might be a problem, since the decorator 'dec'
will point to another object (it could even points to itself if it were a lambda), 
yet we need an Object for each level of decorated function.
To do this all decorated function object have the (Function|Class)Expr as
 origin. This requires that the getOrigin() method will need refinement for those
 QL types.
