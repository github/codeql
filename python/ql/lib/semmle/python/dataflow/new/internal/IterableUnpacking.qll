/**
 * The unpacking assignment takes the general form
 * ```python
 *   sequence = iterable
 * ```
 * where `sequence` is either a tuple or a list and it can contain wildcards.
 * The iterable can be any iterable, which means that (CodeQL modeling of) content
 * will need to change type if it should be transferred from the LHS to the RHS.
 *
 * Note that (CodeQL modeling of) content does not have to change type on data-flow
 * paths _inside_ the LHS, as the different allowed syntaxes here are merely a convenience.
 * Consequently, we model all LHS sequences as tuples, which have the more precise content
 * model, making flow to the elements more precise. If an element is a starred variable,
 * we will have to mutate the content type to be list content.
 *
 * We may for instance have
 * ```python
 *    (a, b) = ["a", SOURCE]  # RHS has content `ListElementContent`
 * ```
 * Due to the abstraction for list content, we do not know whether `SOURCE`
 * ends up in `a` or in `b`, so we want to overapproximate and see it in both.
 *
 * Using wildcards we may have
 * ```python
 *   (a, *b) = ("a", "b", SOURCE)  # RHS has content `TupleElementContent(2)`
 * ```
 * Since the starred variables are always assigned (Python-)type list, `*b` will be
 * `["b", SOURCE]`, and we will again overapproximate and assign it
 * content corresponding to anything found in the RHS.
 *
 * For a precise transfer
 * ```python
 *    (a, b) = ("a", SOURCE)  # RHS has content `TupleElementContent(1)`
 * ```
 * we wish to keep the precision, so only `b` receives the tuple content at index 1.
 *
 * Finally, `sequence` is actually a pattern and can have a more complicated structure,
 * such as
 * ```python
 *   (a, [b, *c]) = ("a", ["b", SOURCE])  # RHS has content `TupleElementContent(1); ListElementContent`
 * ```
 * where `a` should not receive content, but `b` and `c` should. `c` will be `[SOURCE]` so
 * should have the content transferred, while `b` should read it.
 *
 * To transfer content from RHS to the elements of the LHS in the expression `sequence = iterable`,
 * we use two synthetic nodes:
 *
 * - `TIterableSequence(sequence)` which captures the content-modeling the entire `sequence` will have
 * (essentially just a copy of the content-modeling the RHS has)
 *
 * - `TIterableElement(sequence)` which captures the content-modeling that will be assigned to an element.
 * Note that an empty access path means that the value we are tracking flows directly to the element.
 *
 *
 * The `TIterableSequence(sequence)` is at this point superfluous but becomes useful when handling recursive
 * structures in the LHS, where `sequence` is some internal sequence node. We can have a uniform treatment
 * by always having these two synthetic nodes. So we transfer to (or, in the recursive case, read into)
 * `TIterableSequence(sequence)`, from which we take a read step to `TIterableElement(sequence)` and then a
 * store step to `sequence`.
 *
 * This allows the unknown content from the RHS to be read into `TIterableElement(sequence)` and tuple content
 * to then be stored into `sequence`. If the content is already tuple content, this indirection creates crosstalk
 * between indices. Therefore, tuple content is never read into `TIterableElement(sequence)`; it is instead
 * transferred directly from `TIterableSequence(sequence)` to `sequence` via a flow step. Such a flow step will
 * also transfer other content, but only tuple content is further read from `sequence` into its elements.
 *
 * The strategy is then via several read-, store-, and flow steps:
 * 1. a) [Flow] Content is transferred from `iterable` to `TIterableSequence(sequence)` via a
 *    flow step. From here, everything happens on the LHS.
 *
 *    b) [Read] If the unpacking happens inside a for as in
 *    ```python
 *       for sequence in iterable
 *    ```
 *    then content is read from `iterable` to `TIterableSequence(sequence)`.
 *
 * 2. [Flow] Content is transferred from `TIterableSequence(sequence)` to `sequence` via a
 *    flow step. (Here only tuple content is relevant.)
 *
 * 3. [Read] Content is read from `TIterableSequence(sequence)` into  `TIterableElement(sequence)`.
 *    As `sequence` is modeled as a tuple, we will not read tuple content as that would allow
 *    crosstalk.
 *
 * 4. [Store] Content is stored from `TIterableElement(sequence)` to `sequence`.
 *    Content type is `TupleElementContent` with indices taken from the syntax.
 *    For instance, if `sequence` is `(a, *b, c)`, content is written to index 0, 1, and 2.
 *    This is adequate as the route through `TIterableElement(sequence)` does not transfer precise content.
 *
 * 5. [Read] Content is read from `sequence` to its elements.
 *    a) If the element is a plain variable, the target is the corresponding essa node.
 *
 *    b) If the element is itself a sequence, with control-flow node `seq`, the target is `TIterableSequence(seq)`.
 *
 *    c) If the element is a starred variable, with control-flow node `v`, the target is `TIterableElement(v)`.
 *
 * 6. [Store] Content is stored from `TIterableElement(v)` to the essa variable for `v`, with
 *    content type `ListElementContent`.
 *
 * 7. [Flow, Read, Store] Steps 2 through 7 are repeated for all recursive elements which are sequences.
 *
 *
 * We illustrate the above steps on the assignment
 *
 * ```python
 * (a, b) = ["a", SOURCE]
 * ```
 *
 * Looking at the content propagation to `a`:
 *   `["a", SOURCE]`: [ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 1a-->
 *
 *   `TIterableSequence((a, b))`: [ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 3-->
 *
 *   `TIterableElement((a, b))`: []
 *
 * --Step 4-->
 *
 *   `(a, b)`: [TupleElementContent(0)]
 *
 * --Step 5a-->
 *
 *   `a`: []
 *
 * Meaning there is data-flow from the RHS to `a` (an over approximation). The same logic would be applied to show there is data-flow to `b`. Note that _Step 3_ and _Step 4_ would not have been needed if the RHS had been a tuple (since that would have been able to use _Step 2_ instead).
 *
 * Another, more complicated example:
 * ```python
 *   (a, [b, *c]) = ["a", [SOURCE]]
 * ```
 * where the path to `c` is
 *
 *   `["a", [SOURCE]]`: [ListElementContent; ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 1a-->
 *
 *   `TIterableSequence((a, [b, *c]))`: [ListElementContent; ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 3-->
 *
 *   `TIterableElement((a, [b, *c]))`: [ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 4-->
 *
 *   `(a, [b, *c])`: [TupleElementContent(1); ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 5b-->
 *
 *   `TIterableSequence([b, *c])`: [ListElementContent]
 *
 * --Step 3-->
 *
 *   `TIterableElement([b, *c])`: []
 *
 * --Step 4-->
 *
 *   `[b, *c]`: [TupleElementContent(1)]
 *
 * --Step 5c-->
 *
 *   `TIterableElement(c)`: []
 *
 * --Step 6-->
 *
 *  `c`: [ListElementContent]
