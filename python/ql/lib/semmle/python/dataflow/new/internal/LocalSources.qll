 * A data flow node that is a source of local flow. This includes things like

 * - Function parameters

 *
 * Local source nodes and the `flowsTo` relation should be thought of in terms of the reference
 * semantics of the underlying object. For instance, in the following snippet of code
 *
 * ```python
 *     x = []
 *     x.append(1)
 *     x.append(2)
 * ```
 *
 * the local source node corresponding to the occurrences of `x` is the empty list that is assigned to `x`
 * originally. Even though the two `append` calls modify the value of `x`, they do not change the fact that
 * `x` still points to the same object. If, however, we next do `x = x + [3]`, then the expression `x + [3]`
 * will be the new local source of what `x` now points to.
