- use shared type tracking library (?)
- add to local source nodes (or type tracking nodes?):
  - entry SSA node
  - return nodes
  - target nodes of type tracking store steps
- type tracking, load, store and level steps
- use proper content in type tracking (rather than string)

independent pre-steps:

- create type tracking nodes
- use shared type tracking library (?)
- use proper content in type tracking (rather than string)

- align treatment of taint through collections
- rewrite defaultAdditionalTaintStep to use flow summaries
