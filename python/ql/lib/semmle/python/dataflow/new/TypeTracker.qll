/**
 * The summary of the steps needed to track a value to a given dataflow node.
 *
 * This can be used to track objects that implement a certain API in order to
 * recognize calls to that API. Note that type-tracking does not by itself provide a
 * source/sink relation, that is, it may determine that a node has a given type,
 * but it won't determine where that type came from.
 *
 * It is recommended that all uses of this type are written in the following form,
 * for tracking some type `myType`:
 * ```ql
 * DataFlow::TypeTrackingNode myType(DataFlow::TypeTracker t) {
 *   t.start() and
 *   result = < source of myType >
 *   or
 *   exists (DataFlow::TypeTracker t2 |
 *     result = myType(t2).track(t2, t)
 *   )
 * }
 *
 * DataFlow::LocalSourceNode myType() { myType(DataFlow::TypeTracker::end()) }
 * ```
 *
 * Instead of `result = myType(t2).track(t2, t)`, you can also use the equivalent
 * `t = t2.step(myType(t2), result)`. If you additionally want to track individual
 * intra-procedural steps, use `t = t2.smallstep(myCallback(t2), result)`.
