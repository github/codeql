 * A taint-tracking configuration for detecting "path injection" vulnerabilities.
 *
 * This configuration uses two flow states, `NotNormalized` and `NormalizedUnchecked`,
 * to track the requirement that a file path must be first normalized and then checked
 * before it is safe to use.
 *
 * At sources, paths are assumed not normalized. At normalization points, they change
 * state to `NormalizedUnchecked` after which they can be made safe by an appropriate
 * check of the prefix.
 *
 * Such checks are ineffective in the `NotNormalized` state.
