## 0.11.9

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The name "certification" is no longer seen as possibly being a certificate, and will therefore no longer be flagged in queries like "clear-text-logging" which look for sensitive data.
* Added modeling of the `psycopg` PyPI package as a SQL database library.
