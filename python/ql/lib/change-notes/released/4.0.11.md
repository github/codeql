## 4.0.11

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Type annotations such as `foo : Bar` are now treated by the call graph as an indication that `foo` may be an instance of `Bar`.

### Bug Fixes

- The Python parser is now able to correctly parse expressions such as `match[1]` and `match()` where `match` is not used as a keyword.
