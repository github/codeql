## 0.9.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Type tracking is now aware of reads of captured variables (variables defined in an outer scope). This leads to a richer API graph, and may lead to more results in some queries.
* Added more content-flow/field-flow for dictionaries, by adding support for reads through `mydict.get("key")` and `mydict.setdefault("key", value)`, and store steps through `dict["key"] = value` and `mydict.setdefault("key", value)`.
