## 2.1.0

### New Features

* Added support for custom threat-models, which can be used in most of our taint-tracking queries, see our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#extending-codeql-coverage-with-threat-models) for more details.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The common sanitizer guard `StringConstCompareBarrier` has been renamed to `ConstCompareBarrier` and expanded to cover comparisons with other constant values such as `None`. This may result in fewer false positive results for several queries.
