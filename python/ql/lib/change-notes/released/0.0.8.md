## 0.0.8

### Deprecated APIs

* Moved the files defining regex injection configuration and customization, instead of `import semmle.python.security.injection.RegexInjection` please use `import semmle.python.security.dataflow.RegexInjection` (the same for `RegexInjectionCustomizations`).
* The `codeql/python-upgrades` CodeQL pack has been removed. All upgrades scripts have been merged into the `codeql/python-all` CodeQL pack.
