## 6.1.0

### New Features

* It is now possible to refer to list elements in the Python models-as-data language, via the `ListElement` path.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The predicate `SummarizedCallable.propagatesFlow` has been extended with the columns `Provenance p` and `boolean isExact`, and as a consequence the predicates `SummarizedCallable.hasProvenance` and `SummarizedCallable.hasExactModel` have been removed.
* Added experimental query `py/prompt-injection` to detect potential prompt injection vulnerabilities in code using LLMs.
* Added taint flow model and type model for `agents` and `openai` modules.
* Remote flow sources for the `websockets` package have been modeled.
