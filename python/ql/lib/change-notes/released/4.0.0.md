## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the old deprecated TypeTracking library.
* Deleted the deprecated `classRef` predicate from the `FieldStorage` module, use `subclassRef` instead.
* Deleted a lot of deprecated modules and predicates from `Stdlib.qll`, use API-graphs directly instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Additional data flow models for the builtin functions `map`, `filter`, `zip`, and `enumerate` have been added.
