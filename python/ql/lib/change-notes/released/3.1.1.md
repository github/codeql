## 3.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The sensitive data library has been improved so that `snake_case` style variable names are recognized more reliably. This may result in more sensitive data being identified, and more results from queries that use the sensitive data library.
- Additional taint steps through methods of `lxml.etree.Element` and `lxml.etree.ElementTree` objects from the `lxml` PyPI package have been modeled.
