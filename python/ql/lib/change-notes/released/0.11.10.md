## 0.11.10

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed missing flow for dictionary updates (`d[<key>] = ...`) when `<key>` is a string constant not used in dictionary literals or as name of keyword-argument.
* Fixed flow for iterable unpacking (`a,b = my_tuple`) when it occurs on top-level (module) scope.
