## 0.10.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Support analyzing packages (folders with python code) that do not have `__init__.py` files, although this is technically required, we see real world projects that don't have this.
* Added modeling of AWS Lambda handlers that can be identified with `AWS::Serverless::Function` in YAML files, where the event parameter is modeled as a remote-flow-source.
* Improvements of the `aiohttp` models including remote-flow-sources from type annotations, new path manipulation, and SSRF sinks.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the computation of locations for imports with aliases in jump-to-definition.
