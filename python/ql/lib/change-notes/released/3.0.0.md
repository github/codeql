## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the old deprecated data flow API that was based on extending a configuration class. See https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-14-new-dataflow-api-for-writing-custom-codeql-queries for instructions on migrating your queries to use the new API.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a problem with the control-flow graph construction, where writing `case True:` or `case False:` would cause parts of the graph to be pruned by mistake.
