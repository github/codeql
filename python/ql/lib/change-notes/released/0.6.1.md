## 0.6.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added the ability to refer to subscript operations in the API graph. It is now possible to write `response().getMember("cookies").getASubscript()` to find code like `resp.cookies["key"]` (assuming `response` returns an API node for response objects).
* Added modeling of creating Flask responses with `flask.jsonify`.
