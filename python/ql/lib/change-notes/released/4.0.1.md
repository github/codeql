## 4.0.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the extractor where a comment inside a subscript could sometimes cause the AST to be missing nodes.
- Using the `break` and `continue` keywords outside of a loop, which is a syntax error but is accepted by our parser, would cause the control-flow construction to fail. This is now no longer the case.
