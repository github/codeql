## 6.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added request forgery sink models for the Azure SDK.
* Made it so that models-as-data sinks with the kind `request-forgery` contribute to the class `Http::Client::Request` which represents HTTP client requests.

### Bug Fixes

- Using `=` as a fill character in a format specifier (e.g `f"{x:=^20}"`) now no longer results in a syntax error during parsing.
