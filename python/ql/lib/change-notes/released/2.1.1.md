## 2.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Modelled that `re.finditer` returns an iterable of `re.Match` objects. This is now understood by the API graph in many cases.
* Type tracking, and hence the API graph, is now able to correctly trace through comprehensions.
* More precise modelling of the dataflow through comprehensions. In particular, captured variables are now handled correctly.
* Dataflow out of yield is added, allowing proper tracing through generators.
* Added several models of standard library functions and classes, in anticipation of no longer extracting the standard library in a future release.
