## 0.10.1

### New Features

* The `DataFlow::StateConfigSig` signature module has gained default implementations for `isBarrier/2` and `isAdditionalFlowStep/4`. 
  Hence it is no longer needed to provide `none()` implementations of these predicates if they are not needed.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flow configurations can now include a predicate `neverSkip(Node node)`
  in order to ensure inclusion of certain nodes in the path explanations. The
  predicate defaults to the end-points of the additional flow steps provided in
  the configuration, which means that such steps now always are visible by
  default in path explanations.
* Add support for Models as Data for Reflected XSS query
* Parameters with a default value are now considered a `DefinitionNode`. This improvement was motivated by allowing type-tracking and API graphs to follow flow from such a default value to a use by a captured variable.
