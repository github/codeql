## 3.1.0

### New Features

* Added support for parameter annotations in API graphs. This means that in a function definition such as `def foo(x: Bar): ...`, you can now use the `getInstanceFromAnnotation()` method to step from `Bar` to `x`. In addition to this, the `getAnInstance` method now also includes instances arising from parameter annotations.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added modeling of `fastapi.Request` and `starlette.requests.Request` as sources of untrusted input,
  and modeling of tainted data flow out of these request objects.
