## 4.0.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

- Added the methods `getMinArguments` and `getMaxArguments` to the `Function` class. These return the minimum and maximum positional arguments that the given function accepts.

### Bug Fixes

- `MatchLiteralPattern`s such as `case None: ...` are now never pruned from the extracted source code. This fixes some situations where code was wrongly identified as unreachable.
