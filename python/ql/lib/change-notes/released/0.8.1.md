### Major Analysis Improvements

* We use a new analysis for the call-graph (determining which function is called). This can lead to changed results. In most cases this is much more accurate than the old call-graph that was based on points-to, but we do lose a few valid edges in the call-graph, especially around methods that are not defined inside its class.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed module resolution so we properly recognize definitions made within if-then-else statements.
* Added modeling of cryptographic operations in the `hmac` library.
