## 0.9.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The recently introduced new data flow and taint tracking APIs have had a
  number of module and predicate renamings. The old APIs remain in place for
  now.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added modeling of SQL execution in the packages `sqlite3.dbapi2`, `cassandra-driver`, `aiosqlite`, and the functions `sqlite3.Connection.executescript`/`sqlite3.Cursor.executescript` and `asyncpg.connection.connect()`.
* Fixed module resolution so we allow imports of definitions that have had an attribute assigned to it, such as `class Foo; Foo.bar = 42`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed some accidental predicate visibility in the backwards-compatible wrapper for data flow configurations. In particular, `DataFlow::hasFlowPath`, `DataFlow::hasFlow`, `DataFlow::hasFlowTo`, and `DataFlow::hasFlowToExpr` were accidentally exposed in a single version.
