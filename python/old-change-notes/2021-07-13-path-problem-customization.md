* Changed the way to provide extra sources/sinks for `@kind path-problem` queries, to avoid a potential performance problem due to re-evaluation of data-flow configurations. Please use the new `<query>Customization.qll` files and extend their classes instead (such as extending the `Sink` class from `python/ql/src/semmle/python/security/dataflow/SqlInjectionCustomizations.qll`). This is relevant for the queries: `py/sql-injection`, `py/code-injection`, `py/command-line-injection`, `py/reflective-xss`, `py/url-redirection`, `py/unsafe-deserialization`, `py/stack-trace-exposure`, `py/path-injection`.
