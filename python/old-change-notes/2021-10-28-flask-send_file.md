* Added modeling of the `send_from_directory` and `send_file` functions from the `flask` PyPI package, resulting in additional sinks for the _Uncontrolled data used in path expression_ (`py/path-injection`) query. This addition was originally [submitted as an external contribution by @porcupineyhairs](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/6330).
