* A new abstract class `ConfigurationTestFile` (`semmle.code.cpp.ConfigurationTestFile.ConfigurationTestFile`) was introduced, which represents files created to test the build configuration. A subclass `CmakeTryCompileFile` of `ConfigurationTestFile` was also introduced, which represents files created by CMake to test the build configuration.
