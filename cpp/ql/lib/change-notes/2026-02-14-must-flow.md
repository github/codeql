* `MustFlow`, the inter-procedural must-flow data flow analysis library, has been re-worked to use parameterized modules. Like in the case of data flow and taint tracking, instead of extending the `MustFlowConfiguration` class, the user should now implement a module with the `MustFlow::ConfigSig` signature, and instantiate the `MustFlow::Global` parameterized module with the implemented module.
