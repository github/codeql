* The analysis of C/C++ code targeting 64-bit Arm platforms has been improved. This includes support for the Arm-specific builtin functions, support for the `arm_neon.h` header and Neon vector types, and support for the `fp8` scalar type. The `arm_sve.h` header and scalable vectors are only partially supported at this point.
