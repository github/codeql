## 0.12.5

### New Features

* Added the `PreprocBlock.qll` library to this repository.  This library offers a view of `#if`, `#elif`, `#else` and similar directives as a tree with navigable parent-child relationships.
* Added a new `ThrowingFunction` abstract class that can be used to model an external function that may throw an exception.
