## 5.5.0

### New Features

* Added a new class `PchFile` representing precompiled header (PCH) files used during project compilation.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added flow summaries for the `Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr` member functions.
* The new dataflow/taint-tracking library (`semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow` and `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.TaintTracking`) now resolves virtual function calls more precisely. This results in fewer false positives when running dataflow/taint-tracking queries on C++ projects.
