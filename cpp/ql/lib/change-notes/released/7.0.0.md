## 7.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* The `_Decimal32`, `_Decimal64`, and `_Decimal128` types are no longer exposed as builtin types. Support for these gcc-specific types was incomplete, and are generally not used in C/C++ codebases.

### Deprecated APIs

* The `OverloadedArrayExpr::getArrayOffset/0` predicate has been deprecated. Use `OverloadedArrayExpr::getArrayOffset/1` and `OverloadedArrayExpr::getAnArrayOffset` instead.

### New Features

* Added subclasses of `BuiltInOperations` for the `__is_bitwise_cloneable`, `__is_invocable`, and `__is_nothrow_invocable` builtin operations.
* Added a `isThisAccess` predicate to `ParamAccessForType` that holds when the access is to the implicit object parameter.
* Predicates `getArrayOffset/1` and `getAnArrayOffset` have been added to the `OverloadedArrayExpr` class to support C++23 multidimensional subscript operators.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Some constants will now be represented by their unfolded expression trees. The `isConstant` predicate of `Expr` will no longer yield a result for those constants.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug in the `DataFlow::BarrierGuard<...>::getABarrierNode` predicate which caused the predicate to return `DataFlow::Node`s with incorrect indirections. If you use `getABarrierNode` to implement barriers in a dataflow/taint-tracking query it may result in more query results. You can use `DataFlow::BarrierGuard<...>::getAnIndirectBarrierNode` to remove those query results.
