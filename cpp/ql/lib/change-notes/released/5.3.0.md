## 5.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The `UnknownDefaultLocation`, `UnknownExprLocation`, and `UnknownStmtLocation` classes have been deprecated. Use `UnknownLocation` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The analysis of C/C++ code targeting 64-bit Arm platforms has been improved. This includes support for the Arm-specific builtin functions, support for the `arm_neon.h` header and Neon vector types, and support for the `fp8` scalar type. The `arm_sve.h` header and scalable vectors are only partially supported at this point.
* Added support for `__fp16 _Complex` and `__bf16 _Complex` types
* Added `sql-injection` sink models for the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) database library functions `OCIStmtPrepare` and `OCIStmtPrepare2`.
