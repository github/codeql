## 3.2.0

### New Features

* Add a new predicate `getAnIndirectBarrier` to the parameterized module `InstructionBarrierGuard` in `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow` for computing indirect dataflow nodes that are guarded by a given instruction. This predicate is similar to the `getAnIndirectBarrier` predicate on the parameterized module `BarrierGuard`.
* A new predicate `getDecltype`was added to the `ProxyClass` class, which yields the decltype for the proxy class.
* Template classes that are of `struct` type are now also instances of the `Struct` class.
* Template classes that are of `union` type are now also instances of the `Union` class.
* A new abstract class `ConfigurationTestFile` (`semmle.code.cpp.ConfigurationTestFile.ConfigurationTestFile`) was introduced, which represents files created to test the build configuration. A subclass `CmakeTryCompileFile` of `ConfigurationTestFile` was also introduced, which represents files created by CMake to test the build configuration.
* New predicates `getARequiresClause`, `getTemplateRequiresClause` and `getFunctionRequiresClause` were added to the `FunctionDeclarationEntry` class, which yield the requires clauses when the entry represents a function template declaration with requires clauses.
* A new predicate `getRequiresClause` was added to the `TypeDeclarationEntry` class, which yields the requires clause when the entry represents a class template declaration with a requires clause.
* A new predicate `getRequiresClause` was added to the `VariableDeclarationEntry` class, which yields the requires clause when the entry represents a variable template declaration with a requires clause.
* A new predicate `getTypeConstraint` was added to the `TypeTemplateParameter` class, which yields the type constraint of the parameter if it exists.
* A new class `VariableTemplateSpecialization` was introduced, which represents explicit specializations of variable templates.
* A new predicate `isSpecialization` was added to the `Variable` class, which holds if the variable is a template specialization.
* A new class `ConceptIdExpr` was introduced, which represents C++20 concept id expressions.
* A new class `Concept` was introduced, which represents C++20 concepts.
* The `getTemplateArgumentType` and `getTemplateArgumentValue` predicates of the `Declaration` class now also yield template arguments of concepts.
* A new class `ConstevalIfStmt` was introduced, which represents the C++23 `if consteval` and `if ! consteval` statements.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* `DefaultOptions::exits` now holds for C23 functions with the `_Noreturn` or `___Noreturn__` attribute.
