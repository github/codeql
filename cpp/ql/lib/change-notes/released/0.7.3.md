## 0.7.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted the deprecated `hasCopyConstructor` predicate from the `Class` class in `Class.qll`.
* Deleted many deprecated predicates and classes with uppercase `AST`, `SSA`, `CFG`, `API`, etc. in their names. Use the PascalCased versions instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `CodeDuplication.qll` file.
