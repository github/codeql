## 0.13.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the deprecated `GlobalValueNumberingImpl.qll` implementation.

### New Features

* Models-as-Data support has been added for C/C++. This feature allows flow sources, sinks and summaries to be expressed in compact strings as an alternative to modelling each source / sink / summary with explicit QL. See `dataflow/ExternalFlow.qll` for documentation and specification of the model format, and `models/implementations/ZMQ.qll` for a simple example of models. Importing models from `.yml` is not yet supported.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Source models have been added for the standard library function `getc` (and variations).
* Source, sink and flow models for the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) networking library have been added.
* Parameters of functions without definitions now have `ParameterNode`s.
* The alias analysis used internally by various libraries has been improved to answer alias questions more conservatively. As a result, some queries may report fewer false positives.
