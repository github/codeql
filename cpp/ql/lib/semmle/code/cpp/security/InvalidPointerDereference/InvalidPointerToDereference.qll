/**
 * This file provides the second phase of the `cpp/invalid-pointer-deref` query that identifies flow
 * from the out-of-bounds pointer identified by the `AllocationToInvalidPointer.qll` library to
 * a dereference of the out-of-bounds pointer.
 *
 * Consider the following snippet:
 * ```cpp
 * 1. char* base = (char*)malloc(size);
 * 2. char* end = base + size;
 * 3. for(char *p = base; p <= end; p++) {
 * 4.   use(*p); // BUG: Should have been bounded by `p < end`.
 * 5. }
 * ```
 * this file identifies the flow from `base + size` to `end`. We call `base + size` the "dereference source" and `end`
 * the "dereference sink" (even though `end` is not actually dereferenced we will use this term because we will perform
 * dataflow to find a use of a pointer `x` such that `x <= end` which is dereferenced. In the above example, `x` is `p`
 * on line 4).
 *
 * Merely _constructing_ a pointer that's out-of-bounds is fine if the pointer is never dereferenced (in reality, the
 * standard only guarantees that it is safe to move the pointer one element past the last element, but we ignore that
 * here). So this step is about identifying which of the out-of-bounds pointers found by `pointerAddInstructionHasBounds`
 * in `AllocationToInvalidPointer.qll` are actually being dereferenced. We do this using a regular dataflow
 * configuration (see `InvalidPointerToDerefConfig`).
 *
 * The dataflow traversal defines the set of sources as any dataflow node `n` such that there exists a pointer-arithmetic
 * instruction `pai` found by `AllocationToInvalidPointer.qll` and a `n.asInstruction() >= pai + deltaDerefSourceAndPai`.
 * Here, `deltaDerefSourceAndPai` is the constant difference between the source we track for finding a dereference and the
 * pointer-arithmetic instruction.
 *
 * The set of sinks is defined as any dataflow node `n` such that `addr <= n.asInstruction() + deltaDerefSinkAndDerefAddress`
 * for some address operand `addr` and constant difference `deltaDerefSinkAndDerefAddress`. Since an address operand is
 * always consumed by an instruction that performs a dereference this lets us identify a "bad dereference". We call the
 * instruction that consumes the address operand the "operation".
 *
 * For example, consider the flow from `base + size` to `end` above. The sink is `end` on line 3 because
 * `p <= end.asInstruction() + deltaDerefSinkAndDerefAddress`, where `p` is the address operand in `use(*p)` and
 * `deltaDerefSinkAndDerefAddress >= 0`. The load attached to `*p` is the "operation". To ensure that the path makes
 * intuitive sense, we only pick operations that are control-flow reachable from the dereference sink.
 *
 * To compute how many elements the dereference is beyond the end position of the allocation, we sum the two deltas
 * `deltaDerefSourceAndPai` and `deltaDerefSinkAndDerefAddress`. This is done in the `operationIsOffBy` predicate
 * (which is the only predicate exposed by this file).
 *
 * Handling false positives:
 *
 * Consider the following snippet:
 * ```cpp
 * 1. char *p = new char[size];
 * 2. char *end = p + size;
 * 3. if (p < end) {
 * 4.   p += 1;
 * 5. }
 * 6. if (p < end) {
 * 7.   int val = *p; // GOOD
 * 8. }
 * ```
 * this is safe because `p` is guarded to be strictly less than `end` on line 6 before the dereference on line 7. However, if we
 * run the query on the above without further modifications we would see an alert on line 7. This is because range analysis infers
 * that `p <= end` after the increment on line 4, and thus the result of `p += 1` is seen as a valid dereference source. This
 * node then flows to `p` on line 6 (which is a valid dereference sink since it non-strictly upper bounds an address operand), and
 * range analysis then infers that the address operand of `*p` (i.e., `p`) is non-strictly upper bounded by `p`, and thus reports
 * an alert on line 7.
 *
 * In order to handle the above false positive, we define a barrier that identifies guards such as `p < end` that ensures that a value
 * is less than the pointer-arithmetic instruction that computed the invalid pointer. This is done in the `InvalidPointerToDerefBarrier`
 * module. Since the node we are tracking is not necessarily _equal_ to the pointer-arithmetic instruction, but rather satisfies
 * `node.asInstruction() <= pai + deltaDerefSourceAndPai`, we need to account for the delta when checking if a guard is sufficiently
 * strong to infer that a future dereference is safe. To do this, we check that the guard guarantees that a node `n` satisfies
 * `n < node + k` where `node` is a node such that `node <= pai`. Thus, we know that any node `m` such that `m <= n + delta` where
 * `delta + k <= 0` will be safe because:
 * ```
 * m <= n + delta
 *   <  node + k + delta
 *   <= pai + k + delta
 *   <= pai
 * ```
