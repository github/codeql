/**
 * Provides classes and predicates for calculating the raw control-flow graph.
 *
 * The predicates in this file produce the _raw_ CFG. Subsequent passes will
 * prune it to remove impossible edges before exposing it through the
 * `ControlFlowNode` class.
 */

/*
 * The calculation is in two stages. First, a graph of _sub-nodes_ is produced.
 * A sub-node is either an actual CFG node or a _virtual node_. Second, the
 * virtual nodes are eliminated from the graph by collapsing edges such that
 * any _actual sub-nodes_ connected through zero or more _virtual sub-nodes_
 * are still connected in the final graph.
 *
 * The graph of sub-nodes is produced by a comprehensive case analysis that
 * specifies the shape of the CFG for all known language constructs. The case
 * analysis is large but does _not_ contain recursion. Recursion is needed in
 * the second stage in order to collapse virtual nodes, but that recursion is
 * simply a transitive closure and so is fast.
 *
 * A sub-node is a pair `(Node, Pos)`, where the type `Node` is
 * `ControlFlowNode`, and `Pos` is usually one of three values: "at", "before",
 * or "after". The "at" position represents the control-flow node itself, and
 * sub-nodes with "at"-positions are what we call _actual_ sub-nodes. Other
 * positions are _virtual_, and they are used for forming paths between actual
 * sub-nodes and will get erased to produce the final graph. The "before" and
 * "after" positions represent the points in control flow just before and after
 * evaluating the associated node and its children.
 *
 * The computation of the sub-edges is a large disjunction in which each case
 * contributes all the edges for a particular type of node. As an example,
 * consider the case for `AddExpr` (`e1 + e2`). We can compute the sub-edges
 * contributed by the `AddExpr` independently of the edges contributed by `e1`
 * and `e2`. The points where the `AddExpr` connects to its children are simply
 * represented as the virtual nodes corresponding to what's "before" and
 * "after" each child. In the cases where edges are computed for each child,
 * these "before" and "after" nodes get their remaining neighbors. Concretely,
 * an `AddExpr e` contributes the following edges:
 *
 *     before(e) -> before(e1)
 *     after(e1) -> before(e2)
 *     after(e2) -> at(e)
 *     at(e)     -> after(e)
 *
 * These four edges are not all connected, but they will be part of a connected
 * graph when all expressions under `e1` and `e2` are added as well. Suppose
 * `e1` and `e2` are of type Literal. Then they contribute the following edges.
 *
 *     before(e1) -> at(e1)
 *     at(e1)     -> after(e1)
 *
 *     before(e2) -> at(e2)
 *     at(e2)     -> after(e2)
 *
 * When the complete graph is transformed to remove the virtual sub-nodes
 * ("before" and "after") and collapse the edges around them, we are left with
 * the correct CFG for `e`:
 *
 *     e1 -> e2 -> e
 *
 * To produce all edges around each control-flow node without recursion, we
 * need to pre-compute the targets of exception sources (throw, propagating
 * handlers, ...) and short-circuiting operators (||, ? :, ...). This
 * pre-computation involves recursion, but it's quick to compute because it
 * only involves the nodes themselves and their (transitive) parents.
 *
 * Many kinds of AST nodes share the same pattern of control flow. To add
 * control flow for a new AST construct, use one of the following predicates.
 * They are listed in order of increasing generality, where less general
 * predicates can be extended with less effort.
 *
 * - PostOrderNode and PreOrderNode
 * - straightLineSparse
 * - subEdge
 * - conditionJumps and conditionJumpsTop
 *
 * For nodes whose flow passes through their children in left-to-right order,
 * the `getControlOrderChildSparse` predicate is used to specify that order.

 *
 * - `BlockStmt`: after ordinary control flow falls off the end of the block
 *   without jumps or exceptions.
 * - `ReturnStmt`: After the statement itself or after its operand (if

 * - `ThrowExpr`: After the `throw` expression or after its operand (if

 * - `JumpStmt` (`BreakStmt`, `ContinueStmt`, `GotoStmt`): after the statement.
 * - A `ForStmt`, `WhileStmt`, `SwitchStmt`, or `IfStmt`: after control flow
 *   falls off the end of the statement without jumping. Destruction can occur
 *   here for `for`-loops that have an initializer (`for (C x = a; ...; ...)`)
 *   and for statements whose condition is a `ConditionDeclExpr`
 *   (`if (C x = a)`).
 * - The `getUpdate()` of a `ForStmt`: after the `getUpdate()` expression. This
 *   can happen when the condition is a `ConditionDeclExpr`
 * - `Handler`: On the edge out of the `Handler` for the case where the
 *   exception was not matched and is propagated to the next handler or
 *   function exit point.
 * - `MicrosoftTryExceptStmt`: After the false-edge out of the `e` in
 *   `__except(e)`, before propagating the exception up to the next handler or
 *   function exit point.
 * - `MicrosoftTryFinallyStmt`: On the edge following the `__finally` block for
 *   the case where an exception was thrown and needs to be propagated.
