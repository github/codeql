 * if the defined location overlaps the use location in any way. Thus, a single instruction may serve as a definition
 * for multiple use locations, since a single definition location may overlap many use locations.
 *
 * Definitions and uses are identified by a block and an integer "offset". An offset of -1 indicates the definition
 * from a `Phi` instruction at the beginning of the block. An offset of 2*i indicates a definition or use on the
 * instruction at index `i` in the block. An offset of 2*i+1 indicates a definition or use on the `Chi` instruction that
 * will be inserted immediately after the instruction at index `i` in the block.
 *
 * For a given use location, each definition and use is also assigned a "rank" within its block. The rank is simply the
 * one-based index of that definition or use within the list of definitions and uses of that location within the block,
 * ordered by offset. The rank allows the various reachability predicates to be computed more efficiently than they
 * would if based solely on offset, since the set of possible ranks is dense while the set of possible offsets is
 * potentially very sparse.
