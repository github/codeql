| test3.cpp:16:5:16:13 | access to array | This buffer may contain multibyte characters, so attempting to copy may result in part of the last character being lost. |
| test3.cpp:36:13:36:18 | ... + ... | This buffer may contain multibyte characters, so an attempt to copy may result in an overflow. |
| test3.cpp:47:3:47:24 | access to array | The size of the array element is greater than one byte, so the offset will point outside the array. |
| test.cpp:66:27:66:32 | call to mbtowc | Size can be less than maximum character length, use macro MB_CUR_MAX. |
