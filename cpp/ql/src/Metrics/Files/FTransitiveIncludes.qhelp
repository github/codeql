<overview>
<p>This metric measures the number of files that are directly or indirectly included using <code>#include</code>.</p>

<p>The value of this metric is usually directly correlated to the file's
build time: the more included files, the longer the compilation time.</p>

<p>Often, files with a large number of includes do not require most of the included definitions, so they are contributing to unnecessarily long build times.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>

<ul>
<li>Remove redundant <code>#include</code> directives</li>
<li>Use the specific header file required, if possible, rather than a high-level header that includes many other header files as well</li>
<li>Split header files that contain lots of unrelated definitions or include large unrelated header files</li>
</ul>

</recommendation>
