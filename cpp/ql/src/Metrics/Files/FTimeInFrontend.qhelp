<overview>
<p>This metric measures the amount of time (in milliseconds) spent compiling a C/C++ file, including time spent processing all files included by the pre-processor.</p>

<p>Files that take too long to build usually have too many includes. </p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Files that take a long time to build should be checked to see if they are including only the necessary files in order to reduce build time.</p>

</recommendation>
