<overview>
<p>A <i>magic number</i> is a numeric literal (for example, <code>8080</code>,
<code>2048</code>) that is used in the middle of a block of code without
explanation. It is considered good practice to avoid magic numbers by assigning
the numbers to named constants and using the named constants instead. The
reasons for this are twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>A number in isolation can be inexplicable to later programmers, whereas a
named constant (such as <code>MAX_GUESTS</code>) is more readily understood.
</li>
<li>Using the same named constant in many places, makes the code much easier to
update if the requirements change (for example, one more guest is permitted).
</li>
</ol>

<p>This rule finds magic numbers for which there is no pre-existing named
constant (for example, the line marked (4) below).</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Consider creating a <code>const</code> or a macro to encapsulate the literal, 
then replace all the relevant occurrences in the code.</p>
