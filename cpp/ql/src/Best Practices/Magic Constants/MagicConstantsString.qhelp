<overview>
<p>A <i>magic string</i> is a string literal (for example, <code>"SELECT"</code>,
<code>"127.0.0.1"</code>) that is used in the middle of a block of code without
explanation. It is considered good practice to avoid magic strings by assigning
the strings to named constants and using the named constants instead. The
reasons for this are twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>A string in isolation can be inexplicable to later programmers, whereas a
named constant (such as <code>SMTP_HELO</code>) is more readily understood.
</li>
<li>Using the same named constant in many places, makes the code much easier to
update if the requirements change (for example, a protocol is updated).
</li>
</ol>

<p>This rule finds magic strings for which there is no pre-existing named
constant.</p>

<recommendation>

<p>Consider replacing the magic string with a new named constant.</p>
