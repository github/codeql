<overview>
<p>The bounded copy functions <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memmove</code>, <code>strncpy</code>, <code>strncat</code> accept a size argument. 
You should call these functions with a size argument that is derived from the size of the destination buffer. 
Using a size argument that is derived from the source buffer may cause a buffer overflow. 
Buffer overflows can lead to anything from a segmentation fault to a security vulnerability.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>Check the highlighted function calls carefully. 
Ensure that the size parameter is derived from the size of the destination buffer, and 
not the source buffer.</p>

<example>
<p>
The code below shows an example where <code>strncpy</code> is called incorrectly, without checking the size of the destination buffer.
In the second example the call has been updated to include the size of the destination buffer.</p>
