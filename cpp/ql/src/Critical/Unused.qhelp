<overview>
<p>
This query finds variables that are assigned a value but are never read. This is usually an indication of a variable that has been orphaned
due to changes in code, or a defect in the code due to the omission of the unused variable. The unused variables should be
removed to avoid misuse.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Examine the code to see if the variable is no longer needed. If it is unnecessary, remove the variable. 
Otherwise, update the relevant code to use the variable.
