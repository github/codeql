<overview>
<p>Sensitive information that is stored in an unencrypted SQLite database is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the
database.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that if sensitive information is stored in a database then the database is always encrypted.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows two ways of storing information in an SQLite
database. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in cleartext.
In the 'GOOD' case, the database (and thus the credentials) are encrypted.</p>
