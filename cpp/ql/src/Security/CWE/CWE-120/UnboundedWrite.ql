/*
 * --- Summary of CWE-120 alerts ---
 *
 * The essence of CWE-120 is that string / buffer copies that are
 * potentially unbounded, e.g. null terminated string copy,
 * should be controlled e.g. by using strncpy instead of strcpy.
 * In practice this is divided into several queries that
 * handle slightly different sub-cases, exclude some acceptable uses,
 * and produce reasonable messages to fit each issue.
 *
 * cases:
 *    hasExplicitLimit()    exists(getMaxData())  exists(getBufferSize(bw.getDest(), _))) handled by
 *    NO                    NO                    either                                  UnboundedWrite.ql isUnboundedWrite()

/*
 * An unbounded write is, for example `strcpy(..., tainted)`. We're looking
 * for a tainted source buffer of an unbounded write, where this source buffer
 * is a sink in the taint-tracking analysis.
 *
 * In the case of `gets` and `scanf`, where the source buffer is implicit, the
 * `BufferWrite` library reports the source buffer to be the same as the
 * destination buffer. Since those destination-buffer arguments are also
 * modeled in the taint-tracking library as being _sources_ of taint, they are
 * in practice reported as being tainted because the `security.TaintTracking`
 * library does not distinguish between taint going into an argument and out of
 * an argument. Thus, we get the desired alerts.
