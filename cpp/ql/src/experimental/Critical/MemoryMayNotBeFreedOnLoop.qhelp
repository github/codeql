<overview>
<p>
This rule looks for loops that allocate memory, but may break/continue without freeing it. This causes the function to leak memory and may eventually lead to software failure.
</p> 
</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Ensure that the function frees all dynamically allocated memory it has acquired in all circumstances, unless that memory is returned to the caller.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<sample src="MemoryMayNotBeFreedOnLoop.cpp" />

<p>In this example, on the iteration with <code>i == 5</code>, the memory allocated into <code>notfree</code> will not be freed.  To fix this memory leak, a free call should be added for <code>notfree</code> in the if block.</p>
</example>
