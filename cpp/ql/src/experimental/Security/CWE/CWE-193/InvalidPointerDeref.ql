/*
 * High-level description of the query:
 *
 * The goal of this query is to identify issues such as:
 * ```cpp
 * 1. int* base = new int[size];
 * 2. int* end = base + size;
 * 3. for(int* p = base; p <= end; ++p) {
 * 4.   *p = 0; // BUG: Should have been bounded by `p < end`.
 * 5. }
 * ```
 * In order to do this, we split the problem into three subtasks:
 * 1. First, we find flow from `new int[size]` to `base + size`.
 * 2. Then, we find flow from `base + size` to `end` (on line 3).
 * 3. Finally, we use range-analysis to find a write to (or read from) a pointer that may be greater than or equal to `end`.
 *
 * Step 1 is implemented in `AllocationToInvalidPointer.qll`, and step 2 is implemented by
 * `InvalidPointerToDereference.qll`. See those files for the description of these.
 *
 * This file imports both libraries and defines a final dataflow configuration that constructs the full path from
 * the allocation to the dereference of the out-of-bounds pointer. This is done for several reasons:
 * 1. It means the user is able to inspect the entire path from the allocation to the dereference, which can be useful
 *    to understand the problem highlighted.
 * 2. It ensures that the call-contexts line up correctly when we transition from step 1 to step 2. See the
 *    `test_missing_call_context_1` and `test_missing_call_context_2` tests for how this may flag false positives
 *    without this final configuration.
 *
 * The source of the final path is an allocation that is:
 * 1. identified as flowing to an invalid pointer (by `AllocationToInvalidPointer`), and
 * 2. for which the invalid pointer flows to a dereference (as identified by `InvalidPointerToDereference`).
 *
 * The path can be described in 3 "chunks":
 * 1. One path from the allocation to the construction of the invalid pointer
 * 2. Another path from the construction of the invalid pointer to the final pointer that is about to be dereferenced.
 * 3. Finally, a single step from the dataflow node that represents the final pointer to the dereference.
 *
 * Step 1 happens when the flow state is `TInitial`, and step 2 and 3 happen when the flow state is `TPointerArith(pai)`
 * where the pointer-arithmetic instruction `pai` tracks the instruction that generated the out-of-bounds pointer. This
 * instruction is used in the construction of the alert message.
 *
 * The set of pointer-arithmetic instructions that define the `TPointerArith` flow state is restricted to be the pointer-
 * arithmetic instructions that both receive flow from the allocation (as identified by `AllocationToInvalidPointer.qll`),
 * and further flow to a dereference (as identified by `InvalidPointerToDereference.qll`).
