<overview>
<p>Extracting Compressed files with any compression algorithm like gzip can cause to denial of service attacks.</p>
<p>Attackers can compress a huge file which created by repeated similiar byte and convert it to a small compressed file.</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>When you want to decompress a user-provided compressed file you must be careful about the decompression ratio or read these files within a loop byte by byte to be able to manage the decompressed size in each cycle of the loop.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>
Reading uncompressed Gzip file within a loop and check for a threshold size in each cycle.
</p>
<sample src="example_good.cpp"/>

<p>
An Unsafe Approach can be this example which we don't check for uncompressed size.
</p>
<sample src="example_bad.cpp" />

</example>
