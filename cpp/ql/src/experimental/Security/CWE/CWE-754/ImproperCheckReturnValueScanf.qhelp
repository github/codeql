<overview>
<p>The `scanf` family functions does not require the memory pointed to by its additional pointer arguments to be initialized before calling. The user is required to check the return value of `scanf` and similar functions to establish how many of the additional arguments were assigned values. Not checking the return value and reading one of the arguments not assigned a value is undefined behavior and may have unexpected consequences.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
The user should check the return value of `scanf` and related functions and check that any additional argument was assigned a value before reading the additional argument.
</p>
</recommendation>
<example>
<p>The first example below is correct, as value of `i` is only read once it is checked that `scanf` has read one item. The second example is incorrect, as the return value of `scanf` is not checked, and as `scanf` might have failed to read any item before returning.</p>
