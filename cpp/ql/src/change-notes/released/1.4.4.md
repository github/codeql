## 1.4.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Due to changes in the `FunctionWithWrappers` library (`semmle.code.cpp.security.FunctionWithWrappers`) the primary alert location generated by the queries `cpp/path-injection`, `cpp/sql-injection`, `cpp/tainted-format-string`, and `cpp/command-line-injection` may have changed.
* Added flow models for the Win32 API functions `CreateThread`, `CreateRemoteThread`, and `CreateRemoteThreadEx`.
* Improved support for dataflow through function objects and lambda expressions.
* Added flow models for `pthread_create` and `std::thread`.
* The `cpp/incorrect-string-type-conversion` query no longer alerts on incorrect type conversions that occur in unreachable code.
* Added flow models for the GNU C Library.
* Fixed a number of false positives and false negatives in `cpp/global-use-before-init`. Note that this query is not part of any of the default query suites.
* The query `cpp/sql-injection` now can be extended using the `sql-injection` Models as Data (MaD) sink kind.
