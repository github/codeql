### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added flow models for the Win32 API functions `CreateThread`, `CreateRemoteThread`, and `CreateRemoteThreadEx`.
* Added flow models for the GNU C Library.
* Fixed a number of false positives and false negatives in `cpp/global-use-before-init`. Note that this query is not part of any of the default query suites.
