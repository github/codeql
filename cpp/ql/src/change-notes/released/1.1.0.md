## 1.1.0

### Query Metadata Changes

* The precision of `cpp/iterator-to-expired-container` ("Iterator to expired container") has been increased to `high`. As a result, it will be run by default as part of the Code Scanning suite.
* The precision of `cpp/unsafe-strncat` ("Potentially unsafe call to strncat") has been increased to `high`. As a result, it will be run by default as part of the Code Scanning suite.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `cpp/unsigned-difference-expression-compared-zero` ("Unsigned difference expression compared to zero") query now produces fewer false positives.
