## 0.0.7

### New Queries

* The "Uncontrolled data in arithmetic expression" (cpp/uncontrolled-arithmetic) query has been enhanced to reduce false positive results and its @precision increased to high.
* A new `cpp/very-likely-overruning-write` query has been added to the default query suite for C/C++. The query reports some results that were formerly flagged by `cpp/overruning-write`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added exception for GLib's gboolean to cpp/ambiguously-signed-bit-field.
  This change reduces the number of false positives in the query.
