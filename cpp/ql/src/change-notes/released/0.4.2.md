## 0.4.2

### New Queries

* Added a new medium-precision query, `cpp/comma-before-misleading-indentation`, which detects instances of whitespace that have readability issues.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Unterminated variadic call" (`cpp/unterminated-variadic-call`) query has been tuned to produce fewer false positive results.
* Fixed false positives from the "Unused static function" (`cpp/unused-static-function`) query in files that had errors during compilation.
