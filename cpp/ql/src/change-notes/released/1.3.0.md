## 1.3.0

### New Queries

* Added a new high-precision quality query, `cpp/guarded-free`, which detects useless NULL pointer checks before calls to `free`. A variation of this query was originally contributed as an [experimental query by @mario-campos](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/16331).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Call to function with fewer arguments than declared parameters" query (`cpp/too-few-arguments`) no longer produces results if the function has been implicitly declared.
