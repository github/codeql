## 0.7.4

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `cpp/invalid-pointer-deref`, to detect out-of-bounds pointer reads and writes.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Comparison where assignment was intended" query (`cpp/compare-where-assign-meant`) no longer reports comparisons that appear in macro expansions.
* Some queries that had repeated results corresponding to different levels of indirection for `argv` now only have a single result.
* The `cpp/non-constant-format` query no longer considers an assignment on the right-hand side of another assignment to be a source of non-constant format strings. As a result, the query may now produce fewer results.
