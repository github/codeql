## 0.9.2

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `cpp/use-of-unique-pointer-after-lifetime-ends`, to detect uses of the contents unique pointers that will be destroyed immediately.
* The `cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf` query has been added. This finds results where the return value of scanf is not checked correctly. Some of these were previously found by `cpp/missing-check-scanf` and will no longer be reported there.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `cpp/badly-bounded-write` query could report false positives when a pointer was first initialized with a literal and later assigned a dynamically allocated array. These false positives now no longer occur.
