## 0.8.0

### Query Metadata Changes

* The `cpp/double-free` query has been further improved to reduce false positives and its precision has been increased from `medium` to `high`.
* The `cpp/use-after-free` query has been further improved to reduce false positives and its precision has been increased from `medium` to `high`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The queries `cpp/double-free` and `cpp/use-after-free` find fewer false positives
  in cases where a non-returning function is called.
* The number of duplicated dataflow paths reported by queries has been significantly reduced.
