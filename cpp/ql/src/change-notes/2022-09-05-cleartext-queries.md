* Modernizations from "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in buffer" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-buffer`) have been ported to the "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in file" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-file`), "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) and "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in an SQLite database" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-database`) queries. These changes may result in more correct results and fewer false positive results from these queries.
