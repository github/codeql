* A new query, "Potential exposure of sensitive system data to an unauthorized control sphere" (`cpp/potential-system-data-exposure`) has been added. This query is focused on exposure of information that is highly likely to be sensitive, whereas the similar query "Exposure of system data to an unauthorized control sphere" (`cpp/system-data-exposure`) is focused on exposure of information on a channel that is more likely to be intercepted by an attacker.
