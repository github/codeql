/**
 * An instruction representing the effect that a write to a memory may have on potential aliases of
 * that memory.
 *
 * A `ChiInstruction` is inserted immediately after an instruction that writes to memory. The
 * `ChiInstruction` has two operands. The first operand, given by `getTotalOperand()`, represents
 * the previous state of all of the memory that might be aliased by the memory write. The second
 * operand, given by `getPartialOperand()`, represents the memory that was actually modified by the
 * memory write. The result of the `ChiInstruction` represents the same memory as
 * `getTotalOperand()`, updated to include the changes due to the value that was actually stored by
 * the memory write.
 *
 * As an example, suppose that variable `p` and `q` are pointers that may or may not point to the
 * same memory:
 * ```
 * *p = 5;
 * x = *q;
 * ```
 *
 * The IR would look like:
 * ```
 * r1_1 = VariableAddress[p]
 * r1_2 = Load r1_1, m0_0  // Load the value of `p`
 * r1_3 = Constant[5]
 * m1_4 = Store r1_2, r1_3  // Store to `*p`
 * m1_5 = ^Chi m0_1, m1_4  // Side effect of the previous Store on aliased memory
 * r1_6 = VariableAddress[x]
 * r1_7 = VariableAddress[q]
 * r1_8 = Load r1_7, m0_2  // Load the value of `q`
 * r1_9 = Load r1_8, m1_5  // Load the value of `*q`
 * m1_10 = Store r1_6, r1_9  // Store to x
 * ```
 *
 * Note the `Chi` instruction after the store to `*p`. The indicates that the previous contents of
 * aliased memory (`m0_1`) are merged with the new value written by the store (`m1_4`), producing a
 * new version of aliased memory (`m1_5`). On the subsequent load from `*q`, the source operand of
 * `*q` is `m1_5`, indicating that the store to `*p` may (or may not) have updated the memory
 * pointed to by `q`.
 *
 * For more information about how `Chi` instructions are used to model memory side effects, see
 * https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-61053-7_66.pdf.
