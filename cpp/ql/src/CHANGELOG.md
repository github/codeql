## 0.0.11

### Breaking Changes

* The deprecated queries `cpp/duplicate-block`, `cpp/duplicate-function`, `cpp/duplicate-class`, `cpp/duplicate-file`, `cpp/mostly-duplicate-function`,`cpp/similar-file`, `cpp/duplicated-lines-in-files` have been removed.

### Deprecated Predicates and Classes

* The predicates and classes in the `CodeDuplication` library have been deprecated.

### New Queries

* A new query titled "Use of expired stack-address" (`cpp/using-expired-stack-address`) has been added.
  This query finds accesses to expired stack-allocated memory that escaped via a global variable.
* A new `cpp/insufficient-key-size` query has been added to the default query suite for C/C++. The query finds uses of certain cryptographic algorithms where the key size is too small to provide adequate encryption strength.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Failure to use HTTPS URLs" (`cpp/non-https-url`) has been improved reducing false positive results, and its precision has been increased to 'high'.
* The `cpp/system-data-exposure` query has been modernized and has converted to a `path-problem` query. There are now fewer false positive results.

## 0.0.10

### Deprecated Classes

* The `CodeDuplication.Copy`, `CodeDuplication.DuplicateBlock`, and `CodeDuplication.SimilarBlock` classes have been deprecated.

## 0.0.9

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `cpp/open-call-with-mode-argument`, to detect when `open` or `openat` is called with the `O_CREAT` or `O_TMPFILE` flag but when the `mode` argument is omitted.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query has been further improved to reduce false positive results, and upgraded from `medium` to `high` precision.
* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query now finds more results, where a password is stored in a struct field or class member variable.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-file` query has been improved, removing false positives where data is written to a standard output stream.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-buffer` query has been updated to use the `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.TaintTracking` library.
* The `cpp/world-writable-file-creation` query now only detects `open` and `openat` calls with the `O_CREAT` or `O_TMPFILE` flag.

## 0.0.8

### New Queries

* The `security` tag has been added to the `cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory` query. As a result, its results will now appear by default.
* The "Uncontrolled data in arithmetic expression" (cpp/uncontrolled-arithmetic) query has been enhanced to reduce false positive results and its @precision increased to high.
* A new `cpp/very-likely-overruning-write` query has been added to the default query suite for C/C++. The query reports some results that were formerly flagged by `cpp/overruning-write`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fix an issue with the `cpp/declaration-hides-variable` query where it would report variables that are unnamed in a database.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-file` query has been upgraded with non-local taint flow and has been converted to a `path-problem` query.
* The `cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory` query has been improved to produce fewer false positives. The
  query has also been converted to a `path-problem` query.
* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query has been improved in several ways to reduce false positive results.
* The "Potential improper null termination" (`cpp/improper-null-termination`) query now produces fewer false positive results around control flow branches and loops.
* Added exception for GLib's gboolean to cpp/ambiguously-signed-bit-field.
  This change reduces the number of false positives in the query.

## 0.0.7

## 0.0.6

## 0.0.5

### New Queries

* A new query `cpp/certificate-not-checked` has been added for C/C++. The query flags unsafe use of OpenSSL and similar libraries.
* A new query `cpp/certificate-result-conflation` has been added for C/C++. The query flags unsafe use of OpenSSL and similar libraries.

## 0.0.4

### New Queries

* A new query `cpp/non-https-url` has been added for C/C++. The query flags uses of `http` URLs that might be better replaced with `https`.
