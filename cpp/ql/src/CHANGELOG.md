No user-facing changes.

## 0.5.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `cpp/no-space-for-terminator` and `cpp/uncontrolled-allocation-size` queries have been enhanced with heuristic detection of allocations. These queries now find more results.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `AlertSuppression.ql` query has been updated to support the new `// codeql[query-id]` supression comments. These comments can be used to suppress an alert and must be placed on a blank line before the alert. In addition the legacy `// lgtm` and `// lgtm[query-id]` comments can now also be placed on the line before an alert.
* The `cpp/missing-check-scanf` query no longer reports the free'ing of `scanf` output variables as potential reads.

## 0.4.6

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.5

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.4

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a bug in `cpp/jsf/av-rule-76` that caused the query to miss results when an implicitly-defined copy constructor or copy assignment operator was generated.

## 0.4.2

### New Queries

* Added a new medium-precision query, `cpp/comma-before-misleading-indentation`, which detects instances of whitespace that have readability issues.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Unterminated variadic call" (`cpp/unterminated-variadic-call`) query has been tuned to produce fewer false positive results.
* Fixed false positives from the "Unused static function" (`cpp/unused-static-function`) query in files that had errors during compilation.

## 0.4.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The alert message of many queries have been changed to better follow the style guide and make the message consistent with other languages.

## 0.4.0

### New Queries

* Added a new medium-precision query, `cpp/missing-check-scanf`, which detects `scanf` output variables that are used without a proper return-value check to see that they were actually written. A variation of this query was originally contributed as an [experimental query by @ihsinme](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/8246).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Modernizations from "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in buffer" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-buffer`) have been ported to the "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in file" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-file`), "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) and "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in an SQLite database" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-database`) queries. These changes may result in more correct results and fewer false positive results from these queries.
* The alert message of many queries have been changed to make the message consistent with other languages.

## 0.3.4

## 0.3.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Cleartext storage of sensitive information in buffer" (`cpp/cleartext-storage-buffer`) query has been improved to produce fewer false positives.

## 0.3.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `cpp/bad-strncpy-size` now covers more `strncpy`-like functions than before, including `strxfrm`(`_l`), `wcsxfrm`(`_l`), and `stpncpy`. Users of this query may see an increase in results.

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

* Contextual queries and the query libraries they depend on have been moved to the `codeql/cpp-all` package.

## 0.2.0

## 0.1.4

## 0.1.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "XML external entity expansion" (`cpp/external-entity-expansion`) query precision has been increased to `high`.
* The `cpp/unused-local-variable` no longer ignores functions that include `if` and `switch` statements with C++17-style initializers.

## 0.1.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "XML external entity expansion" (`cpp/external-entity-expansion`) query has been extended to support a broader selection of XML libraries and interfaces.

## 0.1.1

### New Queries

* An new query `cpp/external-entity-expansion` has been added. The query detects XML objects that are vulnerable to external entity expansion (XXE) attacks.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `cpp/cleartext-transmission` query now recognizes additional sources, for sensitive private data such as e-mail addresses and credit card numbers.
* The `cpp/unused-local-variable` no longer ignores functions that include lambda expressions capturing trivially copyable objects.
* The `cpp/command-line-injection` query now takes into account calling contexts across string concatenations. This removes false positives due to mismatched calling contexts before and after string concatenations.
* A new query, "Potential exposure of sensitive system data to an unauthorized control sphere" (`cpp/potential-system-data-exposure`) has been added. This query is focused on exposure of information that is highly likely to be sensitive, whereas the similar query "Exposure of system data to an unauthorized control sphere" (`cpp/system-data-exposure`) is focused on exposure of information on a channel that is more likely to be intercepted by an attacker.

## 0.0.13

## 0.0.12

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `cpp/overflow-destination`, `cpp/unclear-array-index-validation`, and `cpp/uncontrolled-allocation-size` queries have been modernized and converted to `path-problem` queries and provide more true positive results.
* The `cpp/system-data-exposure` query has been increased from `medium` to `high` precision, following a number of improvements to the query logic.

## 0.0.11

### Breaking Changes

* The deprecated queries `cpp/duplicate-block`, `cpp/duplicate-function`, `cpp/duplicate-class`, `cpp/duplicate-file`, `cpp/mostly-duplicate-function`,`cpp/similar-file`, `cpp/duplicated-lines-in-files` have been removed.

### Deprecated Predicates and Classes

* The predicates and classes in the `CodeDuplication` library have been deprecated.

### New Queries

* A new query titled "Use of expired stack-address" (`cpp/using-expired-stack-address`) has been added.
  This query finds accesses to expired stack-allocated memory that escaped via a global variable.
* A new `cpp/insufficient-key-size` query has been added to the default query suite for C/C++. The query finds uses of certain cryptographic algorithms where the key size is too small to provide adequate encryption strength.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Failure to use HTTPS URLs" (`cpp/non-https-url`) has been improved reducing false positive results, and its precision has been increased to 'high'.
* The `cpp/system-data-exposure` query has been modernized and has converted to a `path-problem` query. There are now fewer false positive results.

## 0.0.10

### Deprecated Classes

* The `CodeDuplication.Copy`, `CodeDuplication.DuplicateBlock`, and `CodeDuplication.SimilarBlock` classes have been deprecated.

## 0.0.9

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `cpp/open-call-with-mode-argument`, to detect when `open` or `openat` is called with the `O_CREAT` or `O_TMPFILE` flag but when the `mode` argument is omitted.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query has been further improved to reduce false positive results, and upgraded from `medium` to `high` precision.
* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query now finds more results, where a password is stored in a struct field or class member variable.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-file` query has been improved, removing false positives where data is written to a standard output stream.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-buffer` query has been updated to use the `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.TaintTracking` library.
* The `cpp/world-writable-file-creation` query now only detects `open` and `openat` calls with the `O_CREAT` or `O_TMPFILE` flag.

## 0.0.8

### New Queries

* The `security` tag has been added to the `cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory` query. As a result, its results will now appear by default.
* The "Uncontrolled data in arithmetic expression" (cpp/uncontrolled-arithmetic) query has been enhanced to reduce false positive results and its @precision increased to high.
* A new `cpp/very-likely-overrunning-write` query has been added to the default query suite for C/C++. The query reports some results that were formerly flagged by `cpp/overrunning-write`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fix an issue with the `cpp/declaration-hides-variable` query where it would report variables that are unnamed in a database.
* The `cpp/cleartext-storage-file` query has been upgraded with non-local taint flow and has been converted to a `path-problem` query.
* The `cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory` query has been improved to produce fewer false positives. The
  query has also been converted to a `path-problem` query.
* The "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information" (`cpp/cleartext-transmission`) query has been improved in several ways to reduce false positive results.
* The "Potential improper null termination" (`cpp/improper-null-termination`) query now produces fewer false positive results around control flow branches and loops.
* Added exception for GLib's gboolean to cpp/ambiguously-signed-bit-field.
  This change reduces the number of false positives in the query.
