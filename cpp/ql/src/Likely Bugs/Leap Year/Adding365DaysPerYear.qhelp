<p>When performing arithmetic operations on a variable that represents a date, leap years must be taken into account.
It is not safe to assume that a year is 365 days long.</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>Determine whether the time span in question contains a leap day, then perform the calculation using the correct number
of days.  Alternatively, use an established library routine that already contains correct leap year logic.</p>
</recommendation>
