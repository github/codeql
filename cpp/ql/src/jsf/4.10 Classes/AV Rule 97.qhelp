<!-- Make this more verbose -->
<overview>
<p>
This rule finds class members (functions or data) that are or use arrays. This is particularly important for
functions with array type parameters, as these parameters are treated as pointers to the array's first element
inside the function (array decay). Assuming that it is still has the type of the array passed to the function can cause unexpected
behavior (e.g. when using the <code>sizeof</code> operator).
</p>


</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
Use the <code>Array</code> class, or explicitly declare the variable/parameter as a pointer so there is no possibility for confusion.
