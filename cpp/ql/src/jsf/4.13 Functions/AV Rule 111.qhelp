<p>
This query highlights return statements that return pointers to an object allocated on the stack. The lifetime
of a stack allocated memory location only lasts until the function returns, , and 
the contents of that memory become undefined after that. Clearly, using a pointer to stack 
memory after the function has already returned will have undefined results.

<recommendation>
<p>
Do not return pointers to stack memory locations. Instead, create an output parameter, or create a heap-allocated
buffer, copy the contents of the stack allocated memory to that buffer and return that instead.
