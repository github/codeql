Debian packaging for youtube-dl
-------------------------------

# Basic building of the package

A quick summary of how one can update the Debian packaging of youtube-dl is
to, assuming that one already has the packages `devscripts`,
`git-buildpackage`, and `pristine-tar` installed:

    gbp clone --all https://github.com/rbrito/pkg-youtube-dl
    cd pkg-youtube-dl
    gbp import-orig --pristine-tar --uscan
    gbp dch -S -a
    [ Make here some adaptations, like updating debian/patches, if needed ]
    gbp buildpackage -us -uc # create a test build

    # Final (source only) package creation:

    gbp dch -R -a
    gbp buildpackage -S -k8F930BD1934C3E2140A258790747BD39BCFCAAAA --git-tag

    # Push the results to the repositories:
    git push --all; git push --tags
    git push git@salsa.debian.org:debian/youtube-dl.git --all; git push git@salsa.debian.org:debian/youtube-dl.git --tags
    dput ftp-master youtube-dl*changes

These are the important steps and may need to be changed according to
deviations, say, in the release process of upstream releases (e.g., if
upstream changes the location where the tarballs reside).

Maintaining the repository
--------------------------

I keep my development of the package (in particular, the master branch) at
GitHub and I usually try to have my changes there, since I am not always
with my SSH/GPG keys at hand.

For the benefit of the co-maintainers, I keep a backup copy of the changes
at salsa.debian.org, where, due to said keys not being available at all times,
I can't push my changes, which leads, sometimes to my GitHub repository to
be ahead of the Debian mirror.

I prefer that, if possible, when working with the master branch:

* Please, check if I don't have changes already made at:

      https://github.com/rbrito/pkg-youtube-dl

* People send me pull requests there

* If they are not comfortable with the use of GitHub for any kind of reason
  (political, ideological etc.), that they send me patches via email (git
  send-email is best).

  This can be sent to my personal email or to the Debian BTS. I'm flexible.

Of course, if it is not possible to coordinate in the way described above,
alas... :-(
