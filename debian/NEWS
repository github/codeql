youtube-dl (2015.06.04.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with Debian's version 2015.06.04.1-1, the handling of video
  formats has been revamped in youtube-dl.  In particular, the option
  `--max-quality` doesn't exist anymore.  This is likely to break scripts
  and/or other programs that use this option.

  Please, refer to the manpage (in particular to the section named
  "FORMAT SELECTION") for more details.

youtube-dl (2014.02.17-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  There are too many goodies that this new release brings us,
  including that it is possible to combine/merge/multiplex audio and
  video formats that Youtube now offers separately (See the previous
  notes about Youtube using DASH for video and audio).

  Now, if you want a 480p video in H.264 format, High profile, with
  128kbps AAC audio (this used to be Youtube's format 35), you can
  specify format `-f 135+140` on the command-line, and so on. Only your
  imagination is the limit.

  verbose news.

youtube-dl (2013.10.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From http://cynic.cc/blog/posts/2013-10-23-assorted_news/:

   [13]Some people may have noticed, others may not, but when downloading
   videos from Youtube, they apparently are getting more aggressive with
   the use of [14]Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (also called DASH)
   and, as a result, some (perhaps going to be all in the near future?) of
   the videos may not be available in the resolution/formats that you used
   to like (like me, with format number 35).

   By the way, one thing that is interesting with youtube videos provided
   via DASH is that they are available in different streams: one for the
   video and another for the audio.

   What does this mean in practical terms for users of youtube-dl? Well,
   if you wanted to download videos in resolutions like the 480p (format
   35) that I mentioned, then you will probably have to change your way of
   doing things, until a more automated solution is in place.

   You will have to download both the audio and the video and, then,
   "combine" them (that is, multiplex them) to create one "normal" video
   file with both the audio and the video. I usually do this via:

   ffmpeg -i audio.m4a -i video.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy combined.mp4

   If you prefer having a Matroska container instead of an mp4 container
   (which, BTW, results in smaller muxing overhead), then you can use the
   command line:

   mkvmerge -o combined.mkv audio.m4a video.mp4

   Oh, those m4a and mp4 extensions are a new addition that [15]I just
   sent upstream (in the past, both would have been named with an
   extension of mp4).

   As, an aside, I like formats 135 for video and 140 for audio, for the
   reasons that I mentioned in a comments to issue 1612:

     Otherwise, to download 480p videos (which I do for lectures and so
     on with other projects of mine, like edx-dl) I have to call
     youtube-dl twice: once for format 135 and another for format 140,
     since the old (?) format 35 files are much smaller than the lower
     resolution 360p files (due to the former being encoded in High
     profile vs. the latter being encoded in Constrained Baseline
     profile).

   While this is unfortunate for some, this is a good thing for others: I
   once had a blind user of youtube-dl asking me if he could avoid
   downloading the whole video just to extract the audio, so that he save
   on bandwidth. Well, now this is possible.

youtube-dl (2010.07.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The upstream author has removed support for the -b ("best format") and
  the -d ("high def") command line options.
  
  The behavior now is to download the best quality for each video.
  If you experience a problem with youtube-dl downloading videos that are
  too large, you should consider using the --max-quality option to limit
  which format to use.
  
  The list of formats (in decreasing quality) can be found with:
  
      grep "available_formats =" /usr/bin/youtube-dl
