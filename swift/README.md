# Swift on CodeQL

> [!NOTE]
> CodeQL analysis for Swift is currently in beta. During the beta, analysis of Swift code, and the accompanying documentation, will not be as comprehensive as for other languages.

## Development

### Building the Swift extractor

First ensure you have Bazel installed, for example with

```bash
brew install bazelisk
```

then from the `ql` directory run

```bash
bazel run //swift:create-extractor-pack
```

If you are running on macOS and you encounter errors mentioning `XXX is unavailable: introduced in macOS YY.ZZ`,
you will need to run this from the root of your `codeql` checkout:

```bash
echo common --macos_sdk_version=$(sw_vers --productVersion) >> local.bazelrc
```

which will install `swift/extractor-pack`.

Notice you can run `bazel run :create-extractor-pack` if you already are in the `swift` directory.

Using `codeql ... --search-path=swift/extractor-pack` will then pick up the Swift extractor. You can also use
`--search-path=.`, as the extractor pack is mentioned in the root `codeql-workspace.yml`. Alternatively, you can
set up the search path
in [the per-user CodeQL configuration file](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/specifying-command-options-in-a-codeql-configuration-file#using-a-codeql-configuration-file)
.

### Code generation

Run

```bash
bazel run //swift/codegen
```

to update generated files. This can be shortened to
`bazel run codegen` if you are in the `swift` directory.

You can also run `../misc/codegen/codegen.py`, as long as you are beneath the `swift` directory.

### Logging configuration

A log file is produced for each run under `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_LOG_DIR` (the usual DB log directory).

You can use the environment variable `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_LOG_LEVELS` to configure levels for
loggers and outputs. This must have the form of a comma separated `spec:min_level` list, where
`spec` is either a glob pattern (made up of alphanumeric, `/`, `*` and `.` characters) for
matching logger names or one of `out:binary`, `out:text`, `out:console` or `out:diagnostics`, and `min_level` is one
of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical` or `no_logs` to turn logs completely off.

Current output default levels are no binary logs, `info` logs or higher in the text file and `warning` logs or higher on
standard error. By default, all loggers are configured with the lowest logging level of all outputs (`info` by default).
Logger names are visible in the textual logs between `[...]`. Examples are `extractor/dispatcher`
or `extractor/<source filename>.trap`. An example of `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_LOG_LEVELS` usage is the following:

```bash
export CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_LOG_LEVELS=out:console:trace,out:text:no_logs,*:warning,*.trap:trace
```

This will turn off generation of a text log file, redirecting all logs to standard error, but will make all loggers only
write warnings or above, except for trap emission logs which will output all logs.

### CLion and the native bazel plugin

You can use [CLion][1] with the official [IntelliJ Bazel plugin][2], creating the project from scratch with default
options. This is known to have issues on non-Linux platforms.

### CMake project

The `CMakeLists.txt` file allows to load the Swift extractor as a CMake project, which allows integration into a wider
variety of IDEs. Building with CMake also creates a `compile_commands.json` compilation database that can be picked up
by even more IDEs. In particular, opening the `swift` directory in VSCode should work.

### Debugging codeql database creation

If you want to debug a specific run of the extractor within an integration test or a complex `codeql database create`
invocation, you can do so using [`gdbserver`][gdbserver] or [`lldb-server`][lldb-server].

[gdbserver]: https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/gdbserver-man.html

[lldb-server]: https://lldb.llvm.org/man/lldb-server.html

For example with `gdbserver`, you can

```bash
export CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_RUN_UNDER="gdbserver :1234"
export CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_SWIFT_RUN_UNDER_FILTER="SomeSwiftSource\.swift"  # can be any regex matching extractor args
```

before starting the database extraction, and when that source is encountered the extractor will be run under
a `gdbserver` instance listening on port 1234. You can then attach to the running debugging server from `gdb` or your
IDE. Please refer to your IDE's instructions for how to set up remote debugging.

In particular for breakpoints to work you might need to setup the following remote path mapping:

| Remote      | Local                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `swift`     | `/absolute/path/to/codeql/swift`     |
| `bazel-out` | `/absolute/path/to/codeql/bazel-out` |

### Thread safety

The extractor is single-threaded, and there was no effort to make anything in it thread-safe.
