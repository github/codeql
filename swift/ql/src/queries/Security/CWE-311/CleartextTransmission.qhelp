<overview>

<p>Sensitive information that is transmitted without encryption may be accessible to an attacker.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>

<p>Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being transmitted over the network. In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext. Avoid transmitting sensitive information when it is not necessary to.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>

<p>The following example shows three cases of transmitting information. In the 'BAD' case, the data transmitted is sensitive (a credit card number) and is not encrypted.  In the 'GOOD' cases, the data is either not sensitive, or is protected with encryption.</p>
