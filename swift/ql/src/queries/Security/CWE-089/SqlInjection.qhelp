<p>
If a database query (such as a SQL query) is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a user may be able to run malicious database queries. An attacker can craft the part of the query they control to change the overall meaning of the query.

<recommendation>

<p>
Most database connector libraries offer a way to safely embed untrusted data into a query using query parameters or prepared statements. You should use these features to build queries, rather than string concatenation or similar methods. You can also escape (sanitize) user-controlled strings so that they can be included directly in an SQL command. A library function should be used for escaping, because this approach is only safe if the escaping function is robust against all possible inputs.

<example>

<p>In the following examples, an SQL query is prepared using string interpolation to directly include a user-controlled value <code>userControlledString</code> in the query. An attacker could craft <code>userControlledString</code> to change the overall meaning of the SQL query.

<p>A better way to do this is with a prepared statement, binding <code>userControlledString</code> to a parameter of that statement. An attacker who controls <code>userControlledString</code> now cannot change the overall meaning of the query.
