## 0.2.2

### New Queries

* Added new query "Command injection" (`swift/command-line-injection`). The query finds places where user input is used to execute system commands without proper escaping.
* Added new query "Bad HTML filtering regexp" (`swift/bad-tag-filter`). This query finds regular expressions that match HTML tags in a way that is not robust and can easily lead to security issues.
