## 0.3.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Adder barriers for numeric type values to the injection-like queries, to reduce false positive results where the user input that can be injected is constrainted to a numerical value. The queries updated by this change are: "Predicate built from user-controlled sources" (`swift/predicate-injection`), "Database query built from user-controlled sources" (`swift/sql-injection`), "Uncontrolled format string" (`swift/uncontrolled-format-string`), "JavaScript Injection" (`swift/unsafe-js-eval`) and "Regular expression injection" (`swift/regex-injection`).
* Added additional taint steps to the `swift/cleartext-transmission`, `swift/cleartext-logging` and `swift/cleartext-storage-preferences` queries to identify data within sensitive containers. This is similar to an existing additional taint step in the `swift/cleartext-storage-database` query.
* Added new logging sinks to the `swift/cleartext-logging` query.
* Added sqlite3 and SQLite.swift path injection sinks for the `swift/path-injection` query.
