## 1.0.5

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `swift/constant-salt` ("Use of constant salts") query now considers string concatenation and interpolation as a barrier. As a result, there will be fewer false positive results from this query involving constructed strings.
* The `swift/constant-salt` ("Use of constant salts") query message now contains a link to the source node.
