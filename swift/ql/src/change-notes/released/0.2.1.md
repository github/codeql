## 0.2.1

### New Queries

* Added new query "Regular expression injection" (`swift/regex-injection`). The query finds places where user input is used to construct a regular expression without proper escaping.
* Added new query "Inefficient regular expression" (`swift/redos`). This query finds regular expressions that require exponential time to match certain inputs and may make an application vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
