## 0.3.7

### New Queries

* Added new query "Use of an inappropriate cryptographic hashing algorithm on passwords" (`swift/weak-password-hashing`). This query detects use of inappropriate hashing algorithms for password hashing. Some of the results of this query are new, others would previously have been reported by the "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data" (`swift/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`) query.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The diagnostic query `swift/diagnostics/successfully-extracted-files` now considers any Swift file seen during extraction, even one with some errors, to be extracted / scanned. This affects the Code Scanning UI measure of scanned Swift files.
