* Added new query "Use of an inappropriate cryptographic hashing algorithm on passwords" (`swift/weak-password-hashing`). This query detects use of inappropriate hashing algorithms for password hashing. Some of the results of this query are new, others would previously have been reported by the "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data" (`swift/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`) query.
