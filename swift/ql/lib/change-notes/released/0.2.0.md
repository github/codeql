## 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

* The `BraceStmt` AST node's `AstNode getElement(index)` member predicate no longer returns `VarDecl`s after the `PatternBindingDecl` that declares them. Instead, a new `VarDecl getVariable(index)` predicate has been introduced for accessing the variables declared in a `BraceStmt`.

### New Features

* Added new libraries `Regex.qll` and `RegexTreeView.qll` for reasoning about regular expressions
in Swift code and places where they are evaluated.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added a data flow model for `swap(_:_:)`.
