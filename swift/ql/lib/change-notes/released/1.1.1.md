## 1.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The model for `FileManager` no longer considers methods that return paths on the file system as taint sources. This is because these sources have been found to produce results of low value.
* An error in the model for `URL.withUnsafeFileSystemRepresentation(_:)` has been corrected. This may result in new data flow paths being found during analysis.
