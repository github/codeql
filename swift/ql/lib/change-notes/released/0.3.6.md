## 0.3.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Expanded flow models for `UnsafePointer` and similar classes.
* Added flow models for non-member `withUnsafePointer` and similar functions.
* Added flow models for `withMemoryRebound`, `assumingMemoryBound` and `bindMemory` member functions of library pointer classes.
* Added a sensitive data model for `SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation`.
* Added imprecise flow models for `append` and `insert` methods, and initializer calls with a `data` argument.
* Tyes for patterns are now included in the database and made available through the `Pattern::getType()` method.
