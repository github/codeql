## 1.1.0

### New Features

* Swift support is now out of beta, and generally available.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Additional heuristics for sensitive private information have been added to the `SensitiveExprs.qll` library, improving coverage for credit card and social security numbers. This may result in additional results for queries that use sensitive data such as `swift/cleartext-transmission`.
