## 0.2.3

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Added `DataFlow::CollectionContent`, which will enable more accurate flow through collections.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added local flow sources for `UITextInput` and related classes.
* Flow through forced optional unwrapping (`!`) on the left side of assignment now works in most cases.
* `Type.getName` now gets the name of the type alone without any enclosing types. Use `Type.getFullName` for the old behaviour.
