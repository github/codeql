# Semmle QL

This open source repository contains the standard QL libraries and queries that power [LGTM](https://lgtm.com), and the other products that [Semmle](https://semmle.com) makes available to its customers worldwide.

## How do I learn QL and run queries?

LGTM has [extensive documentation](https://lgtm.com/help/ql/introduction-to-ql) on getting started with writing QL.
You can use the [interactive query console](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/using-query-console) or the [QL for Eclipse](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/running-queries-ide) plugin to try out your queries on any open-source project that's currently being analyzed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our standard library and standard checks. Do you have an idea for a new check, or how to improve an existing query? Then please go ahead and open a pull request! Before you do, though, please take the time to read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [QL style guide](docs/ql-style-guide.md).
