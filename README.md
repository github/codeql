# CodeQL

This open source repository contains the standard CodeQL libraries and queries that power [LGTM](https://lgtm.com) and the other CodeQL products that [GitHub](https://github.com) makes available to its customers worldwide.

## How do I learn CodeQL and run queries?

There is [extensive documentation](https://help.semmle.com/QL/learn-ql/) on getting started with writing CodeQL.
You can use the [interactive query console](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/using-query-console) on LGTM.com or the [CodeQL for Visual Studio Code](https://help.semmle.com/codeql/codeql-for-vscode.html) extension to try out your queries on any open source project that's currently being analyzed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our standard library and standard checks. Do you have an idea for a new check, or how to improve an existing query? Then please go ahead and open a pull request! Before you do, though, please take the time to read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). You can also consult our [style guides](https://github.com/Semmle/ql/tree/master/docs) to learn how to format your code for consistency and clarity, how to write query metadata, and how to write query help documentation for your query.
