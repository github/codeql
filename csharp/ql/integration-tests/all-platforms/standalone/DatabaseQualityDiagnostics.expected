| Scanning C# code completed successfully, but the scan encountered issues. This may be caused by problems identifying dependencies or use of generated source code. Some metrics of the database quality are: Percentage of calls with call target: 25 % (threshold 85 %). Percentage of expressions with known type: 58 % (threshold 85 %). Ideally these metrics should be above their thresholds. Addressing these issues is advisable to avoid false-positives or missing results. If they cannot be addressed, consider scanning C# using either the `autobuild` or `manual` [build modes](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#comparison-of-the-build-modes). | visibilityCliSummaryTable | true |
