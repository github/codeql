### Minor Analysis Improvements

* C# 11: Added extractor support for the `scoped` modifier annotation on parameters and local variables.

## 0.5.2

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Add extractor and library support for UTF-8 encoded strings.
* The `StringLiteral` class includes UTF-8 encoded strings.
* In the DB Scheme `@string_literal_expr` is renamed to `@utf16_string_literal_expr`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* C# 11: Added extractor support for `ref` fields in `ref struct` declarations.

## 0.5.1

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Added library support for generic attributes (also for CIL extracted attributes).
* `cil.ConstructedType::getName` was changed to include printing of the type arguments.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Support for *operators* in interface definitions. 
* C# 11: Added support for the unsigned right shift `>>>` and unsigned right shift assignment `>>>=` operators.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* C# 11: Added support for list- and slice patterns in the extractor.
* Deleted the deprecated `getNameWithoutBrackets` predicate from the `ValueOrRefType` class in `Type.qll`.
* `Element::hasQualifiedName/1` has been deprecated. Use `hasQualifiedName/2` or `hasQualifiedName/3` instead.
* Added TCP/UDP sockets as taint sources.

## 0.4.6

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.5

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `[Summary|Sink|Source]ModelCsv` classes have been deprecated and Models as Data models are defined as data extensions instead.

## 0.4.3

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.2

No user-facing changes.

## 0.4.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* `DateTime` expressions are now considered simple type sanitizers. This affects a wide range of security queries.
* ASP.NET Core controller definition has been made more precise. The amount of introduced taint sources or eliminated false positives should be low though, since the most common pattern is to derive all user defined ASP.NET Core controllers from the standard Controller class, which is not affected. 

## 0.4.0

### Deprecated APIs

* Some classes/modules with upper-case acronyms in their name have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue in the taint tracking analysis where implicit reads were not allowed by default in sinks or additional taint steps that used flow states.

## 0.3.5

## 0.3.4

### Deprecated APIs

* Many classes/predicates/modules with upper-case acronyms in their name have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* All deprecated predicates/classes/modules that have been deprecated for over a year have been deleted.

## 0.3.3

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The `BarrierGuard` class has been deprecated. Such barriers and sanitizers can now instead be created using the new `BarrierGuard` parameterized module.

## 0.2.3

## 0.2.2

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

* The signature of `allowImplicitRead` on `DataFlow::Configuration` and `TaintTracking::Configuration` has changed from `allowImplicitRead(DataFlow::Node node, DataFlow::Content c)` to `allowImplicitRead(DataFlow::Node node, DataFlow::ContentSet c)`.

## 0.1.0

### Breaking Changes

* The recently added flow-state versions of `isBarrierIn`, `isBarrierOut`, `isSanitizerIn`, and `isSanitizerOut` in the data flow and taint tracking libraries have been removed.

## 0.0.13

## 0.0.12

### Breaking Changes

* The flow state variants of `isBarrier` and `isAdditionalFlowStep` are no longer exposed in the taint tracking library. The `isSanitizer` and `isAdditionalTaintStep` predicates should be used instead.

### Deprecated APIs

* Many classes/predicates/modules that had upper-case acronyms have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.

### New Features

* The data flow and taint tracking libraries have been extended with versions of `isBarrierIn`, `isBarrierOut`, and `isBarrierGuard`, respectively `isSanitizerIn`, `isSanitizerOut`, and `isSanitizerGuard`, that support flow states.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* All deprecated predicates/classes/modules that have been deprecated for over a year have been deleted.

## 0.0.11

### Breaking Changes

* The C# extractor no longer supports the following legacy environment variables:
```
ODASA_BUILD_ERROR_DIR
ODASA_CSHARP_LAYOUT
ODASA_SNAPSHOT
SEMMLE_DIST
SEMMLE_EXTRACTOR_OPTIONS
SEMMLE_PLATFORM_TOOLS
SEMMLE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS
SOURCE_ARCHIVE
TRAP_FOLDER
```
* `codeql test run` now extracts source code recursively from sub folders. This may break existing tests that have other tests in nested sub folders, as those will now get the nested test code included.

## 0.0.10

## 0.0.9

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Added support for C# 10 lambda improvements
  * Explicit return types on lambda expressions.
  * Lambda expression can be tagged with method and return value attributes.
* Added support for C# 10 [Extended property patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10#extended-property-patterns).
* Return value attributes are extracted.
* The QL `Attribute` class now has subclasses for each kind of attribute.

## 0.0.8

### Major Analysis Improvements

Added support for the following C# 10 features.
* [Record structs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10#record-structs).
* [Improvements of structure types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10#improvements-of-structure-types).
  * Instance parameterless constructor in a structure type.
