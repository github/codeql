## 0.6.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The recently introduced new data flow and taint tracking APIs have had a
  number of module and predicate renamings. The old APIs remain in place for
  now.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed some accidental predicate visibility in the backwards-compatible wrapper for data flow configurations. In particular `DataFlow::hasFlowPath`, `DataFlow::hasFlow`, `DataFlow::hasFlowTo`, and `DataFlow::hasFlowToExpr` were accidentally exposed in a single version.
