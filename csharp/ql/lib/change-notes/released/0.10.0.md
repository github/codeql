## 0.10.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the deprecated `getAssemblyName` predicate from the `Operator` class. Use `getFunctionName` instead.
* Deleted the deprecated `LShiftOperator`, `RShiftOperator`, `AssignLShiftExpr`, `AssignRShiftExpr`, `LShiftExpr`, and `RShiftExpr` aliases.
* Deleted the deprecated `getCallableDescription` predicate from the `ExternalApiDataNode` class. Use `hasQualifiedName` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Generated .NET Runtime models for properties with both getters and setters have been removed as this is now handled by the data flow library.
