## 5.4.5

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* When a code-scanning configuration specifies the `paths:` and/or `paths-ignore:` settings, these are now taken into account by the C# extractor's search for `.config`, `.props`, XML and project files.
* Updated the generated .NET “models as data” runtime models to cover .NET 10.
* C# 14: Support for *implicit* span conversions in the QL library.
* Basic extractor support for .NET 10 is now available. Extraction is supported for .NET 10 projects in both traced mode and `build mode: none`. However, code that uses language features new to C# 14 is not yet fully supported for extraction and analysis.
* Added autobuilder and `build-mode: none` support for `.slnx` solution files.
* In `build mode: none`, .NET 10 is now used by default unless a specific .NET version is specified elsewhere.
* Added implicit reads of `System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair.Value` at taint-tracking sinks and at inputs to additional taint steps. As a result, taint-tracking queries will now produce more results when a container is tainted.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed two issues affecting build mode `none`:
  * Corrected version sorting logic when detecting the newest .NET framework to use.
  * Improved stability for .NET 10 compatibility.
* Fixed an issue where compiler-generated files were not being extracted. The extractor now runs after compilation completes to ensure all generated files are properly analyzed.
