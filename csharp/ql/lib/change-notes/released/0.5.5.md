## 0.5.5

### New Features

* Added support for merging two `PathGraph`s via disjoint union to allow results from multiple data flow computations in a single `path-problem` query.

### Major Analysis Improvements

* The main data flow and taint tracking APIs have been changed. The old APIs
  remain in place for now and translate to the new through a
  backwards-compatible wrapper. If multiple configurations are in scope
  simultaneously, then this may affect results slightly. The new API is quite
  similar to the old, but makes use of a configuration module instead of a
  configuration class.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Deleted the deprecated `getPath` and `getFolder` predicates from the `XmlFile` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `getAssertionIndex`, and `getAssertedParameter` predicates from the `AssertMethod` class.
* Deleted the deprecated `OverridableMethod` and `OverridableAccessor` classes.
* The `unsafe` predicate for `Modifiable` has been extended to cover delegate return types and identify pointer-like types at any nest level. This is relevant for `unsafe` declarations extracted from assemblies.
