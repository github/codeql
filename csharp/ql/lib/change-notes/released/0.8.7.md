## 0.8.7

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* C# 12: Add extractor support and QL library support for inline arrays.
* Fixed a Log forging false positive when logging the value of a nullable simple type. This fix also applies to all other queries that use the simple type sanitizer.
* The diagnostic query `cs/diagnostics/successfully-extracted-files`, and therefore the Code Scanning UI measure of scanned C# files, now considers any C# file seen during extraction, even one with some errors, to be extracted / scanned.
* A manual neutral summary model for a callable now blocks all generated summary models for that callable from having any effect.
* C# 12: Add extractor support for lambda expressions with parameter defaults like `(int x, int y = 1) => ...` and lambda expressions with a `param` parameter like `(params int[] x) => ...)`.
