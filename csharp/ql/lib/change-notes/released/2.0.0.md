## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted many deprecated taint-tracking configurations based on `TaintTracking::Configuration`. 
* Deleted many deprecated dataflow configurations based on `DataFlow::Configuration`. 
* Deleted the deprecated `explorationLimit` predicate from `DataFlow::Configuration`, use `FlowExploration<explorationLimit>` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Parameters of public methods in abstract controller-like classes are now considered remote flow sources.
* The reported location of `partial` methods has been changed from the definition to the implementation part.
