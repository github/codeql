## 5.4.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved stability when downloading .NET versions by setting appropriate environment variables for `dotnet` commands. The correct architecture-specific version of .NET is now downloaded on ARM runners.
* Compilation errors are now included in the debug log when using build-mode none.
* Added a new extractor option to specify a custom directory for dependency downloads in buildless mode. Use `-O buildless_dependency_dir=<path>` to configure the target directory.
