## 5.4.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The predicate `SummarizedCallable.propagatesFlow` has been extended with the columns `Provenance p` and `boolean isExact`, and as a consequence the predicates `SummarizedCallable.hasProvenance` and `SummarizedCallable.hasExactModel` have been removed.
* C# 14: Support for null-conditional assignments (such as `c?.Prop = p`). Furthermore, the `MaybeNullExpr` class now takes null-conditional access (such as `?.`) into account when modeling potential null values.
