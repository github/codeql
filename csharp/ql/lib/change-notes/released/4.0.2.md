## 4.0.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added extractor support for extracting implicit `ToString` calls in binary `+` expressions and string interpolation expressions.
* The Razor source generator invocation in `build-mode:none` extraction has been changed to use relative file paths instead of absolute ones.
* C# 13: Added extractor support and call dispatch logic (data flow) for the (negative) type parameter constraint `allows ref struct`. Added extractor support for the type parameter constraint `notnull`.
