## 0.0.11

### Breaking Changes

* The C# extractor no longer supports the following legacy environment variables:
```
ODASA_BUILD_ERROR_DIR
ODASA_CSHARP_LAYOUT
ODASA_SNAPSHOT
SEMMLE_DIST
SEMMLE_EXTRACTOR_OPTIONS
SEMMLE_PLATFORM_TOOLS
SEMMLE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS
SOURCE_ARCHIVE
TRAP_FOLDER
```
* `codeql test run` now extracts source code recursively from sub folders. This may break existing tests that have other tests in nested sub folders, as those will now get the nested test code included.
