## 0.5.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* C# 11: Added support for list- and slice patterns in the extractor.
* Deleted the deprecated `getNameWithoutBrackets` predicate from the `ValueOrRefType` class in `Type.qll`.
* `Element::hasQualifiedName/1` has been deprecated. Use `hasQualifiedName/2` or `hasQualifiedName/3` instead.
* Added TCP/UDP sockets as taint sources.
