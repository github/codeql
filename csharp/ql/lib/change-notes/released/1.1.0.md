## 1.1.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Added support for data flow through side-effects on static fields. For example, when a static field containing an array is updated.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added some new `local` source models. Most prominently `System.IO.Path.GetTempPath` and `System.Environment.GetFolderPath`. This might produce more alerts, if the `local` threat model is enabled.
* The extractor has been changed to not skip source files that have already been seen. This has an impact on source files that are compiled multiple times in the build process. Source files with conditional compilation preprocessor directives (such as `#if`) are now extracted for each set of preprocessor symbols that are used during the build process.
