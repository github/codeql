 * Contains customizations to the standard library.

 *
 * Typical examples of customizations include adding new subclasses of abstract classes such as
 * the `RemoteFlowSource` and `SummarizedCallable` classes associated with the security queries
 * to model frameworks that are not covered by the standard library.
