<overview>
<p>ECB should not be used as a mode for encryption. It has dangerous weaknesses. Data is encrypted the same way every time 
meaning the same plaintext input will always produce the same ciphertext. This makes encrypted messages vulnerable 
to replay attacks.</p>

<recommendation>
<p>Use a different CypherMode.</p>
