### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Casts to `dynamic` are excluded from the useless upcasts check (`cs/useless-upcast`).
* The C# extractor now accepts an extractor option `buildless`, which is used to decide what type of extraction that should be performed. If `true` then buildless (standalone) extraction will be performed. Otherwise tracing extraction will be performed (default).
The option is added via `codeql database create --language=csharp -Obuildless=true ...`.
* The C# extractor now accepts an extractor option `trap.compression`, which is used to decide the compression format for TRAP files. The legal values are `brotli` (default), `gzip` or `none`.
The option is added via `codeql database create --language=csharp -Otrap.compression=value ...`.
