<overview>
<p>Casts are often used when you iterate over a collection of elements of a type that is known to 
contain only elements of a different type (possibly more specific). For example, <code>List&lt;Animal
&gt; </code> might refer to a collection of instances of <code>Dog</code>, a class derived from 
<code>Animal</code>. Programmers often write a loop to iterate over the collection and cast each 
<code>Animal</code> in turn to <code>Dog</code> before using it</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>This pattern works well and is also available as the <code>Cast</code> method in LINQ. It is 
better to use a library method in preference to writing your own pattern unless you have a specific 
need for a custom version. In particular, this makes the code easier to read by expressing the 
intent better and reducing the number of distinct variables in scope within the loop. It is 
important to remember that Cast will throw a InvalidCastException if any of the elements cannot be 
cast. (If you are not sure that all of the elements have the expected type, and you only want to 
operate on the ones that do, then consider using <code>OfType</code> instead.)</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<p>In this example, each element in the array of <code>Animal</code>'s is cast to <code>Dog</code>.

<p>This could be written better using LINQ's cast method to cast the whole list and then iterate 
over that.</p>
