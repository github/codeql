<overview>
<p>Writing directly to system output streams is often used as an unstructured form of logging. A 
proper logging mechanism is a better way to direct messages to the desired location and also 
ensures that no critical information is leaked to the standard outputs. The rule points out any 
call to the <code>Console.Write*(...)</code> methods and any access to <code>Console.Out</code> or 
<code>Console.Error</code>.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Use proper logging with a dedicated API. Alternatively redirect standard output and error 
streams by calling <code>Console.SetOut(...)</code> and <code>Console.SetError(...)</code>.</p>
