        <p>Security checks bypass due to a Unicode transformation</p>
        <p>
            If ever a unicode tranformation is performed after some security checks or logical
            validation, the
            latter could be bypassed due to a potential Unicode characters collision.
            The validation of concern are any character escaping, any regex validation or any string
            verification.

    <recommendation>
        <p> Perform a Unicode normalization before the logical validation. </p>
    </recommendation>
    <example>

        <p> The following example showcases the bypass of all checks performed by <code>
            SecurityElement.Escape()</code> due to a post-unicode normalization.</p>
        <p>For instance: the character U+FE64 (<code>ï¹¤</code>) is not filtered-out by the flask
            escape function. But due to the Unicode normalization, the character is transformed and
            would become U+003C (<code> &lt; </code> ).</p>
