<overview>
<p>
  This metric measures the number of tests below this location in the tree.
  At a file level, this would just be the number of test methods in the file.
</p>

<p>
  A method is considered to be a "test method" if one of the major
  unit testing frameworks would invoke it as part of a test
  cycle. Recognized frameworks include NUnit, Microsoft Visual Studio
  Unit Testing Framework, and xUnit.net. For example, methods marked with
  the NUnit <code>Test</code> attribute are counted as test methods.
</p>

<p>
  In general, having many test cases is a good thing rather than a bad
  thing. However, at the file level, tests should typically be grouped
  by the functionality they relate to, which makes a file with an
  exceptionally high number of tests a strong candidate for splitting
  up. At a higher level, this metric makes it possible to compare the
  number of tests in different components, potentially flagging
  functionality that is comparatively under-tested.
</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
  Since it is typically not a problem to have too many tests, this
  metric is usually included for the purposes of collecting
  information, rather than finding problematic areas in the code. With
  that in mind, it is usually a good idea to avoid an excessive number
  of tests in a single file, and to maintain a broadly comparable
  level of testing across components.
</p>

<p>
  When assessing the thoroughness of a code base's test suite, the number
  of test methods provides only part of the story. Test coverage
  statistics allow a more detailed examination of which parts of the
  code deserve improvements in this area.
