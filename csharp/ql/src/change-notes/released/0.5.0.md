## 0.5.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `csharp/telemetry/supported-external-api`, to detect supported 3rd party APIs used in a codebase.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `AlertSuppression.ql` query has been updated to support the new `// codeql[query-id]` supression comments. These comments can be used to suppress an alert and must be placed on a blank line before the alert. In addition the legacy `// lgtm` and `// lgtm[query-id]` comments can now also be placed on the line before an alert.
* The extensible predicates for Models as Data have been renamed (the `ext` prefix has been removed). As an example, `extSummaryModel` has been renamed to `summaryModel`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a bug where the Owin.qll framework library will look for "URI" instead of "Uri" in the OwinRequest class.
