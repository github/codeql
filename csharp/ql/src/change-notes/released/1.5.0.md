## 1.5.0

### New Queries

* The `cs/web/cookie-secure-not-set` and `cs/web/cookie-httponly-not-set` queries have been promoted from experimental to the main query pack.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* An improvement to the Guards library for recognizing disjunctions means improved precision for `cs/constant-condition`, `cs/inefficient-containskey`, and `cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null`. The two former can have additional findings, and the latter will have fewer false positives.
