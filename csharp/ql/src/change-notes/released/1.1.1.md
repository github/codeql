## 1.1.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Enums and `System.DateTimeOffset` are now treated as *simple* types, which means that they are considered to have a sanitizing effect. This impacts many queries, among others the `cs/log-forging` query.
* The MaD models for the .NET 9 Runtime have been re-generated after a fix related to `out`/`ref` parameters.
