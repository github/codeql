## 1.4.0

### Deprecated Queries

* The query `cs/captured-foreach-variable` has been deprecated as the semantics of capturing a 'foreach' variable and using it outside the loop has been stable since C# version 5.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `cs/call-to-object-tostring` has been improved to remove false positives for enum types.

### Bug Fixes

* The message for `csharp/diagnostic/database-quality` has been updated to include detailed database health metrics. Additionally, the threshold for reporting database health issues has been lowered from 95% to 85% (if any metric falls below this percentage). These changes are visible on the tool status page.
