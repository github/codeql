## 0.3.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Parameters of delegates passed to routing endpoint calls like `MapGet` in ASP.NET Core are now considered remote flow sources.
* The query `cs/unsafe-deserialization-untrusted-input` is not reporting on all calls of `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` any longer, it only covers cases that explicitly use unsafe serialization settings.
* Added better support for the SQLite framework in the SQL injection query.
* File streams are now considered stored flow sources. For example, reading query elements from a file can lead to a Second Order SQL injection alert.
