## 0.2.0

### Query Metadata Changes

* The `kind` query metadata was changed to `diagnostic` on `cs/compilation-error`, `cs/compilation-message`, `cs/extraction-error`, and `cs/extraction-message`.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The syntax of the (source|sink|summary)model CSV format has been changed slightly for Java and C#. A new column called `provenance` has been introduced, where the allowed values are `manual` and `generated`. The value used to indicate whether a model as been written by hand (`manual`) or create by the CSV model generator (`generated`).
* All auto implemented public properties with public getters and setters on ASP.NET Core remote flow sources are now also considered to be tainted.
