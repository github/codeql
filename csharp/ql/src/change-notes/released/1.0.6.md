## 1.0.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Attributes in the `System.Runtime.CompilerServices` namespace are ignored when checking if a declaration requires documentation comments.
* C# build-mode `none` analyses now report a warning on the CodeQL status page when there are significant analysis problems -- defined as 5% of expressions lacking a type, or 5% of call targets being unknown. Other messages reported on the status page are downgraded from warnings to notes and so are less prominent, but are still available for review.
