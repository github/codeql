## 0.8.10

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Most data flow queries that track flow from *remote* flow sources now use the current *threat model* configuration instead. This doesn't lead to any changes in the produced alerts (as the default configuration is *remote* flow sources) unless the threat model configuration is changed. The changed queries are `cs/code-injection`, `cs/command-line-injection`, `cs/user-controlled-bypass`, `cs/count-untrusted-data-external-api`, `cs/untrusted-data-to-external-api`, `cs/ldap-injection`, `cs/log-forging`, `cs/xml/missing-validation`, `cs/redos`, `cs/regex-injection`, `cs/resource-injection`, `cs/sql-injection`, `cs/path-injection`, `cs/unsafe-deserialization-untrusted-input`, `cs/web/unvalidated-url-redirection`, `cs/xml/insecure-dtd-handling`, `cs/xml/xpath-injection`, `cs/web/xss`, and `cs/uncontrolled-format-string`.
