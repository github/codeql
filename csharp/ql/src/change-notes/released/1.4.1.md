## 1.4.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The modeling of null guards based on complex pattern expressions has been improved, which in turn improves the query `cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null` by removing false positives.
* The query `cs/xmldoc/missing-summary` has been removed from the `code-quality` suite, to align with other languages.
