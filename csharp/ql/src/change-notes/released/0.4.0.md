### Minor Analysis Improvements

* A new extractor option has been introduced for disabling CIL extraction. Either pass `-Ocil=false` to the `codeql` CLI or set the environment variable `CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_CSHARP_OPTION_CIL=false`.
* The alert message of many queries have been changed to make the message consistent with other languages.
