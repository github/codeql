* Query metadata tags have been systematically updated for many C# queries. Primary categorization as either `reliability` or `maintainability`, and relevant sub-category tags such as `readability`, `useless-code`, `complexity`, `performance`, `correctness`, `error-handling`, and `concurrency`. Aligns with the established [Query file metadata and alert message style guide](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/query-metadata-style-guide.md#quality-query-sub-category-tags).
