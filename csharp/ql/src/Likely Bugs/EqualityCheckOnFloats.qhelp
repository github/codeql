<overview>
<p>Directly comparing two floating point values is dangerous due to the imprecision encountered 
when storing and performing arithmetic on them.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Floating point numbers should be treated as equal if the difference between their values is 
within a certain margin of error. The appropriate margin of error depends on the situation in which 
it is used.</p>

<p>As a cautionary note, floating-point comparison is a non-trivial topic, and our documentation 
here takes a pragmatic approach rather than trying to do it justice. You are strongly advised to 
consult the references for further information.</p>

</recommendation>
<example>
<p>Although you might expect this example to output "True" it actually outputs "False" due to the 
imprecise way floating point arithmetic is performed.</p>
<sample src="EqualityCheckOnFloats.cs" />

<p>The class should be changed to perform a comparison with a tolerance value as in the following 
example.</p>
<sample src="EqualityCheckOnFloatsFix.cs" />
