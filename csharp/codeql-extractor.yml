  buildless:

    description: >
      DEPRECATED: Use `--build-mode none` instead.

      A value indicating, which type of extraction the autobuilder should perform.
      If 'true', then the standalone extractor will be used, otherwise tracing extraction
      will be performed.
      The default is 'false'.
      Note that buildless extraction will generally yield less accurate analysis results,
      and should only be used in cases where it is not possible to build
      the code (for example if it uses inaccessible dependencies).

          The supported levels are (in order of increasing verbosity):
            - off
            - errors
            - warnings
            - info or progress

      [EXPERIMENTAL] The value is a path to the MsBuild binary log file that should be extracted.
      This option only works when `--build-mode none` is also specified.
