          This option is only intended for use in debugging the extractor. Accepted
          values are 'brotli' (the default, to write brotli-compressed TRAP), 'gzip', and 'none'

      A value indicating, which type of extraction the autobuilder should perform.
      If 'true', then the standalone extractor will be used, otherwise tracing extraction
      will be performed.
      The default is 'false'.
      Note that buildless extraction will generally yield less accurate analysis results,
      and should only be used in cases where it is not possible to build
      the code (for example if it uses inaccessible dependencies).
