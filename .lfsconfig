[lfs]
# codeql is publicly forked by many users, and we don't want any LFS file polluting their working
# copies. We therefore exclude everything by default.
# For files required by bazel builds, use rules in `misc/bazel/lfs.bzl` to download them on demand.
# we go for `fetchinclude` to something not exsiting rather than `fetchexclude = *` because the
# former is easier to override (with `git -c` or a local git config) to fetch something specific
fetchinclude = /nothing
