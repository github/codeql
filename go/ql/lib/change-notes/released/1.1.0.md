## 1.1.0

### New Features

* When writing models-as-data models, the receiver is now referred to as `Argument[receiver]` rather than `Argument[-1]`.
* Neutral models are now supported. They have no effect except that a manual neutral summary model will stop a generated summary model from having any effect.
