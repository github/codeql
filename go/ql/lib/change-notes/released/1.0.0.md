## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* A bug has been fixed which meant that the query `go/incorrect-integer-conversion` did not consider type assertions and type switches which use a defined type whose underlying type is an integer type. This may lead to fewer false positive alerts.
* A bug has been fixed which meant flow was not followed through some ranged for loops. This may lead to more alerts being found.
* Added value flow models for the built-in functions `append`, `copy`, `max` and `min` using Models-as-Data. Removed the old-style models for `max` and `min`.
