## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the deprecated `describeBitSize` predicate from `IncorrectIntegerConversionLib.qll`

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Models-as-data models using "Parameter", "Parameter[n]" or "Parameter[n1..n2]" as the output now work correctly.
* By implementing `ImplicitFieldReadNode` it is now possible to declare a dataflow node that reads any content (fields, array members, map keys and values). For example, this is appropriate for modelling a serialization method that flattens a potentially deep data structure into a string or byte array.
* The `Template.Execute[Template]` methods of the `text/template` package now correctly convey taint from any nested fields to their result. This may produce more results from any taint-tracking query when the `text/template` package is in use.
* Added the [rs cors](https://github.com/rs/cors) library to the CorsMisconfiguration.ql query
