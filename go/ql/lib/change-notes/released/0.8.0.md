## 0.8.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the deprecated `CsvRemoteSource` alias. Use `MaDRemoteSource` instead.

### Deprecated APIs

* To make Go consistent with other language libraries, the `UntrustedFlowSource` name has been deprecated throughout. Use `RemoteFlowSource` instead, which replaces it. 
* Where modules have classes named `UntrustedFlowAsSource`, these are also deprecated and the `Source` class in the same module or the `RemoteFlowSource` class should be used instead.
