## 0.6.1

### New Features

* The `DataFlow::StateConfigSig` signature module has gained default implementations for `isBarrier/2` and `isAdditionalFlowStep/4`. 
  Hence it is no longer needed to provide `none()` implementations of these predicates if they are not needed.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flow configurations can now include a predicate `neverSkip(Node node)`
  in order to ensure inclusion of certain nodes in the path explanations. The
  predicate defaults to the end-points of the additional flow steps provided in
  the configuration, which means that such steps now always are visible by
  default in path explanations.
* Parameter nodes now exist for unused parameters as well as used parameters.
* Add support for v4 of the [Go Micro framework](https://github.com/go-micro/go-micro).
* Support for the [Bun framework](https://bun.uptrace.dev/) has been added.
* Support for [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) has been added.
* Support for the [go-pg framework](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) has been improved.
