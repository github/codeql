## 4.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The class `BuiltinType` is now deprecated. Use the new replacement `BuiltinTypeEntity` instead.
* The class `DeclaredType` is now deprecated. Use the new replacement `DeclaredTypeEntity` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added models for the `Head` function and the `Client.Head` method, from the `net/http` package, to the `Http::ClientRequest` class. This means that they will be recognized as sinks for the query `go/request-forgery` and the experimental query `go/ssrf`.
* Previously, `DefinedType.getBaseType` gave the underlying type. It now gives the right hand side of the type declaration, as the documentation indicated that it should.
