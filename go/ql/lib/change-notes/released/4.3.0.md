## 4.3.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The class `BuiltinType` is now deprecated. Use the new replacement `BuiltinTypeEntity` instead.
* The class `DeclaredType` is now deprecated. Use the new replacement `DeclaredTypeEntity` instead.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Previously, `DefinedType.getBaseType` gave the underlying type. It now gives the right hand side of the type declaration, as the documentation indicated that it should.
