## 4.2.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* We no longer track taint into a `sync.Map` via the key of a key-value pair, since we do not model any way in which keys can be read from a `sync.Map`.
* `database` source models have been added for v1 and v2 of the `github.com/couchbase/gocb` package.
* Added `database` source models for the `github.com/Masterminds/squirrel` ORM package.
