## 7.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* The `BasicBlock` class is now defined using the shared basic blocks library. `BasicBlock.getRoot` has been replaced by `BasicBlock.getScope`. `BasicBlock.getAPredecessor` and `BasicBlock.getASuccessor` now take a `SuccessorType` argument. `ReachableJoinBlock.inDominanceFrontierOf` has been removed, so use `BasicBlock.inDominanceFrontier` instead, swapping the receiver and the argument.

### Major Analysis Improvements

* Go 1.26 is now supported.
