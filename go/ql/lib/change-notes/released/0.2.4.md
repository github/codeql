## 0.2.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Go 1.19 is now supported, including adding new taint propagation steps for new standard-library functions introduced in this release.
* Most deprecated predicates/classes/modules that have been deprecated for over a year have been deleted.
* Fixed data-flow to captured variable references.
* We now assume that if a channel-typed field is only referred to twice in the user codebase, once in a send operation and once in a receive, then data flows from the send to the receive statement. This enables finding some cross-goroutine flow.
