## 6.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* The query `go/unexpected-frontend-error` has been moved from the `codeql/go-queries` query to the `codeql-go-consistency-queries` query pack.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* When a code-scanning configuration specifies the `paths:` and/or `paths-ignore:` settings, these are now taken into account by the Go extractor's search for `.vue` and HTML files.
