## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* Deleted the old deprecated data flow API that was based on extending a configuration class. See https://github.blog/changelog/2023-08-14-new-dataflow-api-for-writing-custom-codeql-queries for instructions on migrating your queries to use the new API.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* A call to a method whose name starts with "Debug", "Error", "Fatal", "Info", "Log", "Output", "Panic", "Print", "Trace", "Warn" or "With" defined on an interface whose name ends in "logger" or "Logger" is now considered a LoggerCall. In particular, it is a sink for `go/clear-text-logging` and `go/log-injection`. This may lead to some more alerts in those queries.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug which meant that promoted fields and methods were missing when the embedded parent was not promoted due to a name clash.
