## 0.1.2

### New Features

* Go 1.18 generics are now extracted and can be explored using the new CodeQL classes `TypeParamDecl`, `GenericFunctionInstantiationExpr`, `GenericTypeInstantiationExpr`, `TypeSetTerm`, and `TypeSetLiteralType`, as well as using new predicates defined on the existing `InterfaceType`. Class- and predicate-level documentation can be found in the [Go CodeQL library reference](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-standard-libraries/go/).
