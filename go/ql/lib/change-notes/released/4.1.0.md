## 4.1.0

### Deprecated APIs

* The class `NamedType` has been deprecated. Use the new class `DefinedType` instead. This better matches the terminology used in the Go language specification, which was changed in Go 1.9.
* The member predicate `getNamedType` on `GoMicro::ServiceInterfaceType` has been deprecated. Use the new member predicate `getDefinedType` instead.
* The member predicate `getNamedType` on `Twirp::ServiceInterfaceType` has been deprecated. Use the new member predicate `getDefinedType` instead.
