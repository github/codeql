* Local source models have been added for the APIs which open files in the `io/fs`, `io/ioutil` and `os` packages in the Go standard library. You can optionally include threat models as appropriate when using the CodeQL CLI and in GitHub code scanning. For more information, see [Analyzing your code with CodeQL queries](https://docs.github.com/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/analyzing-your-code-with-codeql-queries#including-model-packs-to-add-potential-sources-of-tainted-data>) and [Customizing your advanced setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#extending-codeql-coverage-with-threat-models).
