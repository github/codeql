* CodeQL Go analysis now supports the "Git Source" type for [private package registries](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/giving-org-access-private-registries). This is in addition to the existing support for the "GOPROXY server" type.
