/**
 * Contains customizations to the standard library.

 * This module is imported by `go.qll`, so any customizations defined here automatically
 * apply to all queries.
 *
 * Typical examples of customizations include adding new subclasses of abstract classes such as
 * `FileSystemAccess`, or the `Source` and `Sink` classes associated with the security queries
 * to model frameworks that are not covered by the standard library.
