  /**
   * A sanitizer guard for zip-slip vulnerabilities which backtracks to sanitize expressions
   * that locally flow into a guarded expression. For example, an ordinary sanitizer guard
   * might say that in `if x { z := y }` the reference to `y` is sanitized because of the guard
   * `x`; these guards say that if the function begins
   * `f(p string) { w := filepath.Join(p); y := filepath.Dir(w) }` then both `p` and `w` are also
   * sanitized as expressions that contributed taint to `y`.
   *
   * This is useful because many sanitizers don't directly check the filename included in an archive
   * header, but some derived expression. It also propagates back from a field reference to its parent
   * (e.g. `hdr.Filename` to `hdr`), increasing the chances that a future reference to `hdr.Filename`
   * will also be regarded as clean (though SSA catches some cases of this).
