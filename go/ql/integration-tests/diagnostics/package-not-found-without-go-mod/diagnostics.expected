To set up access to a private registry, add a step to your workflow which sets up the necessary credentials and environment variables. If any of the packages are already present in the repository, but were not found, then you may need a [custom build command](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/scan-code-for-vulnerabilities/manage-your-configuration/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages).",
