        <p>
        In Go, dividing an integer by zero leads to a panic, which might interrupt execution of the program and lead to program termination.

        <p>
    Check that all user inputs used as a divisor are non-zero. It is also possible to handle a panic, 
    generated by division by zero, using the built-in function <code>recover</code>.

    <example>
        <p>
The following example shows data received from user input being used as a divisor and 
possibly causing a divide-by-zero panic.

        <p>
This can be fixed by testing the divisor against zero:
