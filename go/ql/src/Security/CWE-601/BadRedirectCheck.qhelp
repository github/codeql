<overview>
<p>
Redirect URLs should be checked to ensure that user input cannot cause a site to redirect
to arbitrary domains. This is often done with a check that the redirect URL begins with a slash,
which most of the time is an absolute redirect on the same host. However, browsers interpret URLs
beginning with <code>//</code> or <code>/\</code> as absolute URLs. For example, a redirect to
<code>//example.com</code> will redirect to <code>https://example.com</code>. Thus, redirect checks must
also check the second character of redirect URLs.

<recommendation>
<p>
Also disallow redirect URLs starting with <code>//</code> or <code>/\</code>.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>
The following function validates a (presumably untrusted) redirect URL <code>redir</code>. If it
does not begin with <code>/</code>, the harmless placeholder redirect URL <code>/</code> is
returned to prevent an open redirect; otherwise <code>redir</code> itself is returned.

<p>
While this check provides partial protection, it should be extended to cover <code>//</code> and
<code>/\</code> as well:
</p>
<sample src="BadRedirectCheckGood.go"/>
</example>
