<overview>
<p>
    The <code>ClientConfig</code> specifying the configuration for establishing a SSH connection has a field <code>HostKeyCallback</code> that must be initialized with a function that validates the host key returned by the server.
</p>

<p>
    Not properly verifying the host key returned by a server provides attackers with an opportunity to perform a Machine-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.
    A successful attack can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information communicated with the server.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>ssh</code> package provides the predefined callback <code>InsecureIgnoreHostKey</code> that can be used during development and testing.
    It accepts any provided host key.
    This callback, or a semantically similar callback, should not be used in production code. 
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
The <code>HostKeyCallback</code> field of <code>ClientConfig</code> should be initialized with a function that validates a host key against an allow list.
If a key is not on a predefined allow list, the connection must be terminated and the failed security operation should be logged.
</p>
<p>
When the allow list contains only a single host key then the function <code>FixedHostKey</code> can be used.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The following example shows the use of <code>InsecureIgnoreHostKey</code> and an insecure host key callback implementation commonly used in non-production code.</p>

<sample src="InsecureHostKeyCallbackExample.go" />

<p>The next example shows a secure implementation using the <code>FixedHostKey</code> that implements an allow-list.</p>
