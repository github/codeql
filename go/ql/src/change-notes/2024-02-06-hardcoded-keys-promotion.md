* The query "Use of a hardcoded key for signing JWT" (`go/hardcoded-key`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. Its results will now appear by default as part of `go/hardcoded-credentials`. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @porcupineyhairs](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/9378).
