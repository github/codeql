* Added a new query, `go/weak-crypto-algorithm`, to detect the use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm. A very simple version of this query was originally contributed as an [experimental query by @dilanbhalla](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/pull/284).
* Added a new query, `go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`, to detect the use of a broken or weak cryptographic hash algorithm on sensitive data.
