## 1.5.0

### New Queries

* The `go/cookie-http-only-not-set` query has been promoted from the experimental query pack. This query was originally contributed to the experimental query pack by @edvraa.
* A new query `go/cookie-secure-not-set` has been added to detect cookies without the `Secure` flag set.
* Added a new query, `go/weak-crypto-algorithm`, to detect the use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm. A very simple version of this query was originally contributed as an [experimental query by @dilanbhalla](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/pull/284).
* Added a new query, `go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`, to detect the use of a broken or weak cryptographic hash algorithm on sensitive data.
