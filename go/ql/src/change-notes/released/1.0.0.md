## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `go/incorrect-integer-conversion` has now been restricted to only use flow through value-preserving steps. This reduces false positives, especially around type switches.
