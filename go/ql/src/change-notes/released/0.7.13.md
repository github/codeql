## 0.7.13

### New Queries

* The query "Slice memory allocation with excessive size value" (`go/uncontrolled-allocation-size`) has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. Its results will now appear by default. This query was originally [submitted as an experimental query by @Malayke](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/15130).

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `go/hardcoded-credentials` no longer discards string literals based on "weak password" heuristics.
* The query `go/sql-injection` now recognizes more sinks in the package `github.com/Masterminds/squirrel`.
