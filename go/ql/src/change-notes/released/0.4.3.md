## 0.4.3

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `go/unhandled-writable-file-close`, to detect instances where writable file handles are closed without appropriate checks for errors.

### Query Metadata Changes

* The precision of the `go/log-injection` query was decreased from `high` to `medium`, since it may not be able to identify every way in which log data may be sanitized. This also aligns it with the precision of comparable queries for other languages.
