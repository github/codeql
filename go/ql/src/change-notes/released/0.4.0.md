## 0.4.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `AlertSuppression.ql` query has been updated to support the new `// codeql[query-id]` supression comments. These comments can be used to suppress an alert and must be placed on a blank line before the alert. In addition the legacy `// lgtm` and `// lgtm[query-id]` comments can now also be placed on the line before an alert.
