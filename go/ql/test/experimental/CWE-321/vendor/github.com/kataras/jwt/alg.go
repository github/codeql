// The builtin signing available algorithms.
// Author's recommendation of choosing the best algorithm for your application:
// Already work with RSA public and private keys?
// Choose RSA(RS256/RS384/RS512/PS256/PS384/PS512) (length of produced token characters is bigger).
// If you need the separation between public and private key, choose ECDSA(ES256/ES384/ES512) or EdDSA.
// ECDSA and EdDSA produce smaller tokens than RSA.
// If you need performance and well-tested algorithm, choose HMAC(HS256/HS384/HS512).
// The basic difference between symmetric and an asymmetric algorithm
// is that symmetric uses one shared key for both signing and verifying,
// and the asymmetric uses private key for signing and a public key for verifying.
// In general, asymmetric data is more secure because it uses different keys
// for the signing and verifying process but it's slower than symmetric ones.

	// None for unsecured JWTs.
	// An unsecured JWT may be fit for client-side use.
	// For instance, if the session ID is a hard-to-guess number, and
	// the rest of the data is only used by the client for constructing a
	// view, the use of a signature is superfluous.
	// This data can be used by a single-page web application
	// to construct a view with the "pretty" name for the user
	// without hitting the backend while he gets
	// redirected to his last visited page. Even if a malicious user
	// were to modify this data he or she would gain nothing.
	// Example payload:
	//  {
	//    "sub": "user123",
	//    "session": "ch72gsb320000udocl363eofy",
	//    "name": "Pretty Name",

	// HMAC-SHA signing algorithms.

	//
	// HMAC shared secrets, as used by JWTs, are optimized for speed.
	// This allows many sign/verify operations to be performed efficiently
	// but make brute force attacks easier. So, the length of the shared secret
	// for HS256/384/512 is of the utmost importance. In fact, JSON Web
	// Algorithms9 defines the minimum key length to be equal to the size in bits of the hash function
	// used along with the HMAC algorithm:
	// > A key of the same size as the hash output (for instance, 256 bits for "HS256") or larger
	// MUST be used with this algorithm.‚Äù - JSON Web Algorithms (RFC 7518), 3.2 HMAC with SHA-2 Functions.
	//
	// In other words, many passwords that could be used in other contexts are simply not good enough for
	// use with HMAC-signed JWTs. 256-bits equals 32 ASCII characters, so if you are using something
	// human readable, CONSIDER that number to be the MINIMUM number of characters to include in the
	// secret. Another good option is to switch to RS256 or other public-key algorithms, which are much
	// more robust and flexible. This is NOT SIMPLY A HYPOTHETICAL ATTACK, it has been shown that brute
	// force attacks for HS256 are simple enough to perform11 if the shared secret is too short.
