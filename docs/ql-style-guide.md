# CodeQL style guide

## Introduction

This document describes how to format the code you contribute to this repository. It covers aspects such as layout, white-space, naming, and documentation. Adhering to consistent standards makes code easier to read and maintain. Of course, these are only guidelines, and can be overridden as the need arises on a case-by-case basis. Where existing code deviates from these guidelines, prefer consistency with the surrounding code.
Note, if you use [CodeQL for Visual Studio Code](https://help.semmle.com/codeql/codeql-for-vscode/procedures/about-codeql-for-vscode.html), you can autoformat your query in the editor.

Words in *italic* are defined in the [Glossary](#glossary).

## Indentation
1. *Always* use 2 spaces for indentation.
1. *Always* indent:
   - The *body* of a module, newtype, class or predicate
   - The second and subsequent lines after you use a line break to split a long line
   - The *body* of a `from`, `where` or `select` clause where it spans multiple lines
   - The *body* of a *quantifier* that spans multiple lines


### Examples

```ql
module Helpers {
  /** ... */
  class X ... {
    /** ... */
    int getNumberOfChildren () {
      result = count(int child |
        exists(this.getChild(child))
      )
    }
  }
}
```

```ql
from Call c, string reason
where isDeprecated(c, reason)
select c, "This call to '$@' is deprecated because " + reason + ".",
  c.getTarget(), c.getTarget().getName()
```

## Line breaks
1. Use UNIX line endings.
1. Lines *must not* exceed 100 characters.
1. Long lines *should* be split with a line break, and the following lines *must* be indented one level until the next "regular" line break.
1. There *should* be a single blank line:
   - Between the file documentation and the first `import`
   - Before each declaration, except for the first declaration in a *body*
   - Before the `from`-`where`-`select` section in a query file
1. *Avoid* two or more adjacent blank lines.
1. There *must* be a new line after the *annotations* `cached`, `pragma`, `language` and `bindingset`. Other *annotations* do not have a new line.
1. There *should not* be additional blank lines within a predicate.
1. There *may* be a new line:
   - Immediately after the `from`, `where` or `select` keywords in a query.
   - Immediately after `if`, `then`, or `else` keywords.
1. *Avoid* other line breaks in declarations, other than to break long lines.
1. When operands of *binary operators* span two lines, the operator *should* be placed at the end of the first line.
1. If the parameter list needs to be broken across multiple lines then there *must* be a line break after the opening `(`, the parameter declarations indented one level, and the `) {` *must* be on its own line at the outer indentation.

### Examples

```ql
cached
private int getNumberOfParameters() {
  ...
}
```

```ql
predicate methodStats(
  string qualifiedName, string name, int numberOfParameters,
  int numberOfStatements, int numberOfExpressions, int linesOfCode,
  int nestingDepth, int numberOfBranches
) {
  ...
}
```

```ql
from Method main
where main.getName() = "Main"
select main, "This is the program entry point."
```

```ql
from Method main
where
  main.getName() = "Main" and
  main.getNumberOfParameters() = 0
select main, "Main method has no parameters."
```

```ql
  if x.isPublic()
  then result = "public"
  else result = "private"
```

```ql
  if
    x.isPublic()
  then
    result = "public"
  else
    result = "private"
```

```ql
  if x.isPublic()
  then result = "public"
  else
    if x.isPrivate()
    then result = "private"
    else result = "protected"
```


## Braces
1. Braces follow [Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_Stroustrup) style. The opening `{` *must* be placed at the end of the preceding line.
1. The closing `}` *must* be placed on its own line, indented to the outer level, or be on the same line as the opening `{`.
1. Braces of empty blocks *may* be placed on a single line, with a single space separating the braces.
1. Short predicates, not exceeding the maximum line width, *may* be placed on a single line, with a space following the opening brace and preceding the closing brace.

### Examples

```ql
class ThrowException extends ThrowExpr {
  Foo() {
    this.getTarget() instanceof ExceptionClass
  }

  override string toString() { result = "Throw Exception" }
}
```

## Spaces
1. There *must* be a space or line break:
   - Surrounding each `=` and `|`
   - After each `,`
1. There *should* be a space or line break:
   - Surrounding each *binary operator*, which *must* be balanced
   - Surrounding `..` in a range
   - Exceptions to this may be made to save space or to improve readability.
1. *Avoid* other spaces, for example:
   - After a *quantifier/aggregation* keyword
   - After the predicate name in a *call*
   - Inside brackets used for *calls*, single-line quantifiers, and parenthesised formulas
   - Surrounding a `.`
   - Inside the opening or closing `[ ]` in a range expression
   - Inside casts `a.(X)`
1. *Avoid* multiple spaces, except for indentation, and *avoid* additional indentation to align formulas, parameters or arguments.
1. *Do not* put whitespace on blank lines, or trailing on the end of a line.
1. *Do not* use tabs.


### Examples

```ql
cached
private predicate foo(Expr e, Expr p) {
  exists(int n |
    n in [0 .. 1] |
    e = p.getChild(n + 1)
  )
}
```

## Naming
1. Use [PascalCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase) for:
   - `class` names
   - `module` names
   - `newtype` names
1. Use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for:
   - Predicate names
   - Variable names
1. Newtype predicate names *should* begin with `T`.
1. Predicates that have a result *should* be named `get...`
1. Predicates that can return multiple results *should* be named `getA...` or `getAn...`
1. Predicates that don't have a result or parameters *should* be named `is...` or `has...`
1. *Avoid* underscores in names.
1. *Avoid* short or single-letter names for classes, predicates and fields.
1. Short or single letter names for parameters and *quantifiers* *may* be used provided that they are sufficiently clear.
1. Use names as they are used in the target-language specification.
1. Use American English.

### Examples

```ql
/** ... */
predicate calls(Callable caller, Callable callee) {
  ...
}
```

```ql
/** ... */
class Type extends ... {
  /** ... */
  string getName() { ... }

  /** ... */
  predicate declares(Member m) { ... }

  /** ... */
  predicate isGeneric() { ... }

  /** ... */
  Type getTypeParameter(int n) { ... }

  /** ... */
  Type getATypeParameter() { ... }
}
```

## Documentation

For more information about documenting the code that you contribute to this repository, see the [QLDoc style guide](qldoc-style-guide.md).

## Formulas
1. *Prefer* one *conjunct* per line.
1. Write the `and` at the end of the line. This also applies in `where` clauses.
1. *Prefer* to write the `or` keyword on its own line.
1. The `or` keyword *may* be written at the end of a line, or within a line, provided that it has no `and` operands.
1. Single-line formulas *may* be used in order to save space or add clarity, particularly in the *body* of a *quantifier/aggregation*.
1. *Always* use brackets to clarify the precedence of:
   - `implies`
   - `if`-`then`-`else`
1. *Avoid* using brackets to clarify the precedence of:
   - `not`
   - `and`
   - `or`
1. Parenthesised formulas *can* be written:
   - Within a single line. There *should not* be an additional space following the opening parenthesis or preceding the closing parenthesis.
   - Spanning multiple lines. The opening parenthesis *should* be placed at the end of the preceding line, the body should be indented one level, and the closing bracket should be placed on a new line at the outer indentation.
1. *Quantifiers/aggregations* *can* be written:
   - Within a single line. In this case, there is no space to the inside of the parentheses, or after the quantifier keyword.
   - Across multiple lines. In this case, type declarations are on the same line as the quantifier with the first `|` at the same line as the quantifier, the second `|` *must* be at the end of the same line as the quantifier or on its own line at the outer indentation, and the body of the quantifier *must* be indented one level. The closing `)` is written on a new line, at the outer indentation. If the type declarations need to be broken across multiple lines then there must *must* be a line break after the opening `(`, the type declarations indented one level, and the first `|` on its own line at the outer indentation.
1. `if`-`then`-`else` *can* be written:
   - On a single line
   - With the *body* after the `if`/`then`/`else` keyword
   - With the *body* indented on the next line
   - *Always* parenthesise the `else` part if it is a compound formula.
1. If an `if`-`then`-`else` is broken across multiple lines then the `then` and `else` keywords *should* be at the start of lines aligned with the `if`.
1. The `and` and `else` keywords *may* be placed on the same line as the closing parenthesis.
1. The `and` and `else` keywords *may* be "cuddled": `) else (`
1. *Always* qualify *calls* to predicates of the same class with `this`.
2. *Prefer* postfix casts `a.(Expr)` to prefix casts `(Expr)a`.
