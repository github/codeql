# Experimental CodeQL queries and libraries

In addition to [our supported queries and libraries](supported-queries.md), this repository also contains queries and libraries of a more experimental nature. Experimental queries and libraries can be improved incrementally and may eventually reach a sufficient maturity to be included in our supported queries and libraries.

Experimental queries and libraries may not be actively maintained as the [supported](supported-queries.md) libraries evolve. They may also be changed in backwards-incompatible ways or may be removed entirely in the future without deprecation warnings.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting a new experimental query.
