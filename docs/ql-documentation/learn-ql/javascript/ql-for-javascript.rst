These documents provide an overview of the QL JavaScript and TypeScript standard libraries and show examples of how to use them.

-  `Basic JavaScript QL query <https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/console/ql-javascript-basic-example>`__ describes how to write and run queries using LGTM.

-  :doc:`Introducing the QL libraries for JavaScript <introduce-libraries-js>`: an overview of the standard libraries used to write queries for JavaScript code. There is an extensive QL library for analyzing JavaScript code. This tutorial briefly summarizes the most important QL classes and predicates provided by this library.

-  :doc:`Introducing the QL libraries for TypeScript <introduce-libraries-ts>`: an overview of the standard libraries used to write queries for TypeScript code.

-  :doc:`Analyzing data flow in JavaScript/TypeScript <dataflow>`: demonstrates how to write queries using the standard QL for JavaScript/TypeScript data flow and taint tracking libraries.

-  :doc:`Advanced data-flow analysis using flow labels <flow-labels>`: shows a more advanced example of data flow analysis using flow labels.

-  :doc:`AST class reference <ast-class-reference>`: an overview of all AST classes in the QL standard library for JavaScript.
