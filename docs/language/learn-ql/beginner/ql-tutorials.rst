Welcome to QL! These tutorials are aimed at complete beginners. They teach you how to write QL queries and introduce you to key logic concepts along the way.

We recommend you first read the :doc:`Introduction to the QL language <../introduction-to-ql>` page for a basic description of QL.

Currently the following tutorials are available:

-  :doc:`Find the thief <find-thief-1>` - a three part mystery that introduces logical connectives, quantifiers and aggregates
-  :doc:`Catch the fire starter <fire-1>` - an intriguing search that introduces predicates and classes
-  :doc:`Crown the rightful heir <heir>` - a detective puzzle that introduces recursion
