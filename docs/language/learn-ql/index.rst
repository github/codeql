Learning QL
###########


`QL <https://semmle.com/ql>`__ is the query language used in Semmle's `variant analysis <https://semmle.com/variant-analysis>`__ engine. 
You can use queries written in QL to explore code and quickly find variants of security vulnerabilities and bugs. 
The QL language is also part of the technology behind `LGTM <https://lgtm.com>`__,  Semmle's analysis platform that combines deep semantic code search with data science insights to help developers ship secure code.

QL queries are easy to write and share–visit the topics below and `our open source repository on GitHub <https://github.com/Semmle/ql>`__ to learn more. 
You can also try out QL in the `query console <https://lgtm.com/query>`__ on `LGTM.com <https://lgtm.com>`__. 
Here, you can write QL code to query open source projects directly, without having to download snapshots and libraries.
