Learning CodeQL
###############

CodeQL is the code analysis platform used by security researchers to automate variant analysis. 
You can use CodeQL queries to explore code and quickly find variants of security vulnerabilities and bugs. 
These queries are easy to write and share–visit the topics below and `our open source repository on GitHub <https://github.com/Semmle/ql>`__ to learn more. 
You can also try out CodeQL in the `query console <https://lgtm.com/query>`__ on `LGTM.com <https://lgtm.com>`__. 
Here, you can query open source projects directly, without having to download CodeQL databases and libraries. 

CodeQL is based on a powerful query language called QL. The following topics help you understand QL in general, as well as how to use it when analyzing code with CodeQL.
