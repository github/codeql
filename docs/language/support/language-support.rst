    .. [3] In addition, support is included for the preview features of C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0.
    .. [4] Builds that execute on Java 6 to 12 can be analyzed. The analysis understands Java 12 language features.
    .. [5] ECJ is supported when the build invokes it via the Maven Compiler plugin or the Takari Lifecycle plugin.
    .. [6] JSX and Flow code, YAML, JSON, HTML, and XML files may also be analyzed with JavaScript files. 
    .. [7] TypeScript analysis is performed by running the JavaScript extractor with TypeScript enabled. This is the default for LGTM.
