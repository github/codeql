# Contributing to CodeQL docs

We welcome contributions to our CodeQL docs. Want to improve existing docs or add new information you think would be helpful? Then please go ahead and open a pull request!

## Contributing to CodeQL docs on `codeql.github.com`

To make changes to the documentation on [codeql.github.com](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/), you can make changes to the documentation files using the GitHub UI, a codespace, or a local text editor, and then open a pull request for review. For more information about the format and structure of the CodeQL documentation on [codeql.github.com](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/), please see the [README](README.rst).

## Contributing to CodeQL CLI docs on `docs.github.com`

We have moved documentation about the CodeQL CLI from [github/codeql](docs/codeql) to the public [github/docs](https://github.com/github/docs) repository so that this documentation is published on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli) site. This includes all articles that were under the "[Using the CodeQL CLI](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/using-the-codeql-cli/)" and "[CodeQL CLI reference](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-reference/)" categories on the CodeQL microsite. This will make it easier for code scanning users to find information about using CodeQL to query their codebases.

To contribute to these docs, which are located in the [`codeql-cli`](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/content/code-security/codeql-cli) directory, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the `docs` repository.
