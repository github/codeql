===============================
Exercise: ``snprintf`` overflow
===============================

CodeQL for C/C++

.. rst-class:: setup

Setup
=====

For this example you need to set up `CodeQL for Visual Studio Code <https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code/>`__ and download the CodeQL database for `rsyslog <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog>`__ from GitHub.

``snprintf``
============

.. rst-class:: build

- ``printf``: Returns number of characters printed.

  .. code-block:: cpp
  
    printf("Hello %s!", name)

- ``sprintf``: Returns number of characters written to ``buf``.

  .. code-block:: cpp
  
    sprintf(buf, "Hello %s!", name)
  
- ``snprintf``: Returns number of characters it **would have written** to ``buf`` had ``n`` been sufficiently large, **not** the number of characters actually written.

  .. code-block:: cpp
  
    snprintf(buf, n, "Hello %s!", name)

- In pre-C99 versions of glibc ``snprintf`` would return -1 if ``n`` was too small!

RCE in rsyslog
==============

- Vulnerable code looked similar to this (`original <https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp/blob/532aa362f0f7a8d037505b0a27a1df452f9bac9e/src/tcp.c#L1195-L1211>`__):

  .. code-block:: cpp
  
    char buf[1024];
    int pos = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      pos += snprintf(buf + pos, sizeof(buf) - pos, "%s", strs[i]);
    }

- Disclosed as `CVE-2018-1000140 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000140>`__.

Finding the RCE yourself
========================

#. Write a query to find calls to ``snprintf``

   **Hint**: Use class ``FunctionCall``

#. Restrict to calls whose result is used

   **Hint**: Use class ``ExprInVoidContext``

#. Restrict to calls where the format string contains “%s”

   **Hint**: Use predicates ``Expr.getValue`` and ``string.regexpMatch``

#. Restrict to calls where the result flows back to the size argument

   **Hint**: Import library ``semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.TaintTracking`` and use predicate ``TaintTracking::localTaint``

Model answer
============

.. literalinclude:: ../query-examples/cpp/snprintf-1.ql
   :language: ql

.. rst-class:: build

.. note::

  The regular expression for matching the format string uses the “(?s)” directive to ensure that “.” also matches any newline characters embedded in the string.
