Example: Query injection

CodeQL for Java

.. rst-class:: setup

Setup
=====

For this example you should download:

- `CodeQL for Visual Studio Code <https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code/>`__
- `VIVO Vitro database <http://downloads.lgtm.com/snapshots/java/vivo-project/Vitro/vivo-project_Vitro_java-srcVersion_47ae42c01954432c3c3b92d5d163551ce367f510-dist_odasa-lgtm-2019-04-23-7ceff95-linux64.zip>`__

.. note::

   For this example, we will be analyzing `VIVO Vitro <https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro>`__.

   You can also query the project in `the query console <https://lgtm.com/query/project:14040005/lang:java/>`__ on LGTM.com.
   
   .. insert database-note.rst to explain differences between database available to download and the version available in the query console.

SQL injection
=============

- Occurs when user input is used to construct an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

- Classic example involves constructing a query using string concatenation:

  .. code-block:: sql

     runQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='" + userId + "'");


- If the ``userId`` can be provided by a user, and is not sanitized, then a malicious user can provide input that manipulates the intended query.

- For example, providing the input ``"' OR '1'='1"`` would allow the attacker to return all records in the users table.

.. note::

   `SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`__ is a database query language, which is often used from within other programming languages to interact with a database. The typical case is that a query is to be executed to find some data, based on some input provided by the user - for example, the user’s ID. However, the interface between the host programming language and SQL is typically implemented by passing a string containing the query to some API.

SPARQL injection
================

- `SPARQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL>`__ is a language for querying key-value databases in RDF format.

- The same type of vulnerability can occur for SPARQL as for SQL: if the SPARQL query is constructed through string concatenation, a malicious user can subvert the query:

  .. code-block:: sql
  
     sparqlAskQuery("ASK { <" + individualURI + "> ?p ?o }");

- SPARQL is used by many projects, but we will be looking at `VIVO Vitro <https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro/>`__.

Developing a query
===================

Finding a query concatenation

CodeQL query: find SPARQL methods
=================================

Let’s start by looking for calls to methods with names of the form ``sparql*Query``, using the classes ``Method`` and ``MethodAccess`` from the Java library.

.. rst-class:: build

.. literalinclude:: ../query-examples/java/query-injection-java-1.ql 

.. note::

  - When performing variant analysis, it is usually helpful to write a simple query that finds the simple syntactic pattern, before trying to go on to describe the cases where it goes wrong.
  - In this case, we start by looking for all the method calls that appear to run, before trying to refine the query to find cases which are vulnerable to query injection.
  - The ``select`` clause defines what this query is looking for:
  
    - a ``MethodAccess``: the call to a SPARQL query method
    - a ``Method``: the SPARQL query method.
  
  - The ``where`` part of the query ties these variables together using `predicates <https://codeql.github.com/docs/ql-language-reference/predicates/>`__ defined in the `standard CodeQL library for Java <https://codeql.github.com/codeql-standard-libraries/java/>`__.

CodeQL query: find string concatenation
=======================================

- We now need to define what would make these API calls unsafe.
- A simple heuristic would be to look for string concatenation used in the query argument. 
- We may want to reuse this logic, so let us create a separate predicate.

Looking at autocomplete suggestions, we see that we can get the type of an expression using the ``getType()`` method.

.. rst-class:: build

.. code-block:: ql

   predicate isStringConcat(AddExpr ae) {
     ae.getType() instanceof TypeString
   }

.. note::

  - An important part of the query is to determine whether a given expression is string concatenation.
  - We therefore write a helper predicate for finding string concatenation.
  - This predicate effectively represents the set of all ``add`` expressions in the database where the type of the expression is ``TypeString`` - that is, the addition produces a ``String``   value.

CodeQL query: SPARQL injection
==============================

We can now combine our predicate with the existing query.
Note that we do not need to specify that the argument of the method access is an ``AddExpr`` - this is implied by the ``isStringConcat`` requirement.

Now our query becomes:

.. rst-class:: build

.. literalinclude:: ../query-examples/java/query-injection-java-2.ql
   :language: ql

The final query
===============

.. literalinclude:: ../query-examples/java/query-injection-java-3.ql
   :language: ql

There are two results, one of which was assigned **CVE-2019-6986**.

.. note::

  Full write up and exploit can be found here: https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/tree/master/vivo-project/CVE-2019-6986

Follow up
=========

- Our query successfully finds cases where the concatenation occurs in the argument to the SPARQL API.

- However, in general, the concatenation could occur before the method call.

- For this, we would need to use :doc:`local data flow <data-flow-java>`, which is the topic of the next set of training slides.
