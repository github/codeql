CodeQL query help Sphinx documentation
--------------------------------------

This project supplies the configuration and some boiler plate
index files for the CodeQL query help and CWE coverage documentation.

The query help itself is automatically generated by the 
"Generate CodeQL query help documentation using Sphinx" workflow.

The CWE coverage tables are generated and appended to pages by the "Docs generate query help" workflow in the `semmle-code` repository.
