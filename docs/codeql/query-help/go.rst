.. include:: ../reusables/query-help-overview.rst

These queries are published in the CodeQL query pack ``codeql/go-queries`` (`changelog <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/go/ql/src/CHANGELOG.md>`__, `source <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/go/ql/src>`__).

For shorter queries that you can use as building blocks when writing your own queries, see the `example queries in the CodeQL repository <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/go/ql/examples>`__.
