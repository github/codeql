CodeQL tools
============

GitHub provides the CodeQL command-line interface and CodeQL for Visual Studio
Code for performing CodeQL analysis on open source codebases.

CodeQL command-line interface
-----------------------------

The CodeQL command-line interface (CLI) is primarily used to create databases for 
security research. You can also query CodeQL databases directly from the command line 
or using the Visual Studio Code extension. For more information, see
":ref:`CodeQL CLI <codeql-cli>`."


CodeQL for Visual Studio Code
-----------------------------

You can analyze CodeQL databases in Visual Studio Code using the CodeQL
extension, which provides an enhanced environment for writing and running custom
queries and viewing the results. For more information, see ":ref:`CodeQL
for Visual Studio Code <codeql-for-visual-studio-code>`."
