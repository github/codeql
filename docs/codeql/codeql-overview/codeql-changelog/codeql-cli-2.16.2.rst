Query Packs
-----------

Minor Analysis Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C/C++
"""""

*   Corrected 2 false positive with :code:`cpp/incorrect-string-type-conversion`\ : conversion of byte arrays to wchar and new array allocations converted to wchar.
*   The "Incorrect return-value check for a 'scanf'-like function" query (:code:`cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf`) no longer reports an alert when an explicit check for EOF is added.
*   The "Incorrect return-value check for a 'scanf'-like function" query (:code:`cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf`) now recognizes more EOF checks.
*   The "Potentially uninitialized local variable" query (:code:`cpp/uninitialized-local`) no longer reports an alert when the local variable is used as a qualifier to a static member function call.
*   The diagnostic query :code:`cpp/diagnostics/successfully-extracted-files` now considers any C/C++ file seen during extraction, even one with some errors, to be extracted / scanned. This affects the Code Scanning UI measure of scanned C/C++ files.

C#
""

*   Added string interpolation expressions and :code:`string.Format` as possible sanitizers for the :code:`cs/web/unvalidated-url-redirection` query.

Ruby
""""

*   Added new unsafe deserialization sinks for the ox gem.
*   Added an additional unsafe deserialization sink for the oj gem.

New Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~

Java
""""

*   Added a new query :code:`java/android/sensitive-text` to detect instances of sensitive data being exposed through text fields without being properly masked.
*   Added a new query :code:`java/android/sensitive-notification` to detect instances of sensitive data being exposed through Android notifications.

Ruby
""""

*   Added a new experimental query, :code:`rb/insecure-randomness`, to detect when application uses random values that are not cryptographically secure.

Language Libraries
------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Python
""""""

*   Fixed the :code:`a` (ASCII) inline flag not being recognized by the regular expression library.

Minor Analysis Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C#
""

*   Added a new database relation to store compiler arguments specified inside :code:`@[...].rsp` file arguments. The arguments are returned by :code:`Compilation::getExpandedArgument/1` and :code:`Compilation::getExpandedArguments/0`.
*   C# 12: Added extractor, QL library and data flow support for collection expressions like :code:`[1, y, 4, .. x]`.
*   The C# extractor now accepts an extractor option :code:`logging.verbosity` that specifies the verbosity of the logs. The option is added via :code:`codeql database create --language=csharp -Ologging.verbosity=debug ...` or by setting the corresponding environment variable :code:`CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_CSHARP_OPTION_LOGGING_VERBOSITY`.

Java
""""

*   Added models for the following packages:

    *   com.fasterxml.jackson.databind
    *   javax.servlet
    
*   Added the :code:`java.util.Date` and :code:`java.util.UUID` classes to the list of types in the :code:`SimpleTypeSanitizer` class in :code:`semmle.code.java.security.Sanitizers`.

Python
""""""

*   Added :code:`html.escape` as a sanitizer for HTML.

Ruby
""""

*   Flow is now tracked through Rails :code:`render` calls, when the argument is a :code:`ViewComponent`. In this case, data flow is tracked into the accompanying :code:`.html.erb` file.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

C/C++
"""""

*   Added the :code:`PreprocBlock.qll` library to this repository.  This library offers a view of :code:`#if`, :code:`#elif`, :code:`#else` and similar directives as a tree with navigable parent-child relationships.
*   Added a new :code:`ThrowingFunction` abstract class that can be used to model an external function that may throw an exception.
