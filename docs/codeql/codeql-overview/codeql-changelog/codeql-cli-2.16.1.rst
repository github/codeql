This is an overview of changes in the CodeQL CLI and relevant CodeQL query and library packs. For additional updates on changes to the CodeQL code scanning experience, check out the `code scanning section on the GitHub blog <https://github.blog/tag/code-scanning/>`__, `relevant GitHub Changelog updates <https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/>`__, `changes in the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/GitHub.vscode-codeql/changelog>`__, and the `CodeQL Action changelog <https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Security Coverage
-----------------

CodeQL 2.16.1 runs a total of 406 security queries when configured with the Default suite (covering 160 CWE). The Extended suite enables an additional 129 queries (covering 34 more CWE). 2 security queries have been added with this release.

CodeQL CLI
----------

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   When executing the :code:`codeql database init` command, the CodeQL runner executable path is now stored in the :code:`CODEQL_RUNNER` environment variable.
    Users of indirect tracing on MacOS with System Integrity Protection enabled who previously had trouble with indirect tracing should prefix their build command with this path. For example, :code:`$CODEQL_RUNNER build.sh`.

QL Language
~~~~~~~~~~~

*   Name clashes between weak aliases (i.e. aliases that are not final aliases of non-final entities) of the same target no longer cause ambiguity errors.

Query Packs
-----------

Minor Analysis Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C/C++
"""""

*   The :code:`cpp/include-non-header` style query will now ignore the :code:`.def` extension for textual header inclusions.

C#
""

*   Modelled additional flow steps to track flow from handler methods of a :code:`PageModel` class to the corresponding Razor Page (:code:`.cshtml`) file, which may result in additional results for queries such as :code:`cs/web/xss`.

Golang
""""""

*   The query :code:`go/insecure-randomness` now recognizes the selection of candidates from a predefined set using a weak RNG when the result is used in a sensitive operation. Also, false positives have been reduced by adding more sink exclusions for functions in the :code:`crypto` package not related to cryptographic operations.
*   Added more sources and sinks to the query :code:`go/clear-text-logging`.

Java
""""

*   A manual neutral summary model for a callable now blocks all generated summary models for that callable from having any effect.

JavaScript/TypeScript
"""""""""""""""""""""

*   Added support for `doT <https://github.com/olado/doT>`__ templates.

Python
""""""

*   Added modeling of YARL's :code:`is_absolute` method and checks of the :code:`netloc` of a parsed URL as sanitizers for the :code:`py/url-redirection` query, leading to fewer false positives.

Swift
"""""

*   The diagnostic query :code:`swift/diagnostics/successfully-extracted-files` now considers any Swift file seen during extraction, even one with some errors, to be extracted / scanned. This affects the Code Scanning UI measure of scanned Swift files.

New Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~

Java
""""

*   Added the :code:`java/exec-tainted-environment` query, to detect the injection of environment variables names or values from remote input.

Swift
"""""

*   Added new query "Use of an inappropriate cryptographic hashing algorithm on passwords" (:code:`swift/weak-password-hashing`). This query detects use of inappropriate hashing algorithms for password hashing. Some of the results of this query are new, others would previously have been reported by the "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data" (:code:`swift/weak-sensitive-data-hashing`) query.

Language Libraries
------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Java
""""

*   Fixed regular expressions containing flags not being parsed correctly in some cases.

Minor Analysis Improvements

*   A manual neutral summary model for a callable now blocks all generated summary models for that callable from having any effect.
*   C# 12: Add extractor support for lambda expressions with parameter defaults like :code:`(int x, int y = 1) => ...` and lambda expressions with a :code:`param` parameter like :code:`(params int[] x) => ...)`.

Deprecated APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Java
""""

*   Added a new library :code:`semmle.code.java.security.Sanitizers` which contains a new sanitizer class :code:`SimpleTypeSanitizer`, which represents nodes which cannot realistically carry taint for most queries (e.g. primitives, their boxed equivalents, and numeric types).
*   Converted definitions of :code:`isBarrier` and sanitizer classes to use :code:`SimpleTypeSanitizer` instead of checking if :code:`node.getType()` is :code:`PrimitiveType` or :code:`BoxedType`.

Shared Libraries
----------------

Minor Analysis Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static Single Assignment (SSA)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*   Deleted the deprecated :code:`adjacentDefNoUncertainReads`, :code:`lastRefRedefNoUncertainReads`, and :code:`lastRefNoUncertainReads` predicates.
