Aliases
#######

An alias is an alternative name for an existing QL entity. 

Once you've defined an alias, you can use that new name to refer to the entity in the current module's :ref:`namespace <namespaces>`.

Defining an alias
*****************

You can define an alias in the body of any :ref:`module <modules>`. To do this, you should specify:

#. The keyword ``module``, ``class``, or ``predicate`` to define an alias for a :ref:`module <modules>`, 
   :ref:`type <types>`, or :ref:`non-member predicate <non-member-predicates>` respectively.
#. The name of the alias. This should be a valid name for that kind of entity. For example, a valid predicate 
   alias starts with a lowercase letter.
#. A reference to the QL entity. This includes the original name of the entity and, for predicates, 
   the arity of the predicate.

You can also annotate an alias. See the list of :ref:`annotations <annotations-overview>`
available for aliases.

Note that these annotations apply to the name introduced by the alias (and not
the underlying QL entity itself). For example, an alias can have different visibility 
to the name that it aliases.

Module aliases
==============

Use the following syntax to define an alias for a :ref:`module <modules>`:

.. code-block:: ql

    module ModAlias = ModuleName;

For example, if you create a new module ``NewVersion`` that is an updated version 
of ``OldVersion``, you could deprecate the name ``OldVersion`` as follows:

.. code-block:: ql

    deprecated module OldVersion = NewVersion;

That way both names resolve to the same module, but if you use the name ``OldVersion``,
a deprecation warning is displayed.

.. _type-aliases:

Type aliases
============

Use the following syntax to define an alias for a :ref:`type <types>`:

.. code-block:: ql

    class TypeAlias = TypeName;

Note that ``class`` is just a keyword. You can define an alias for any typeâ€”namely, :ref:`primitive types <primitive-types>`,
:ref:`database types <database-types>` and user-defined :ref:`classes <classes>`.

For example, you can use an alias to abbreviate the name of the primitive type ``boolean`` to ``Bool``:

.. code-block:: ql

    class Bool = boolean;

Or, to use a class ``OneTwo`` defined in a :ref:`module <explicit-modules>` ``M`` in 
``OneTwoThreeLib.qll``, you could create an alias to use the shorter name ``OT`` instead:

.. code-block:: ql

    import OneTwoThreeLib
    
    class OT = M::OneTwo;
    
    ...

    from OT ot 
    select ot

Predicate aliases
=================

Use the following syntax to define an alias for a :ref:`non-member predicate <non-member-predicates>`:

.. code-block:: ql

    predicate PredAlias = PredicateName/Arity;

This works for predicates :ref:`with <predicates-with-result>` or :ref:`without <predicates-without-result>` result. 

For example, suppose you frequently use the following predicate, which calculates the successor of a positive integer 
less than ten:

.. code-block:: ql
    
    int getSuccessor(int i) {
      result = i + 1 and
      i in [1 .. 9]
    }
    
You can use an alias to abbreviate the name to ``succ``:

.. code-block:: ql

    predicate succ = getSuccessor/1;

As an example of a predicate without result, suppose you have a predicate that holds 
for any positive integer less than ten:

.. code-block:: ql

    predicate isSmall(int i) { 
      i in [1 .. 9]
    }

You could give the predicate a more descriptive name as follows:

.. code-block:: ql

    predicate lessThanTen = isSmall/1;
