-  :doc:`Basic query for Python code <basic-query-for-python-code>`: Learn to write and run a simple CodeQL query.

-  :doc:`CodeQL library for Python <codeql-library-for-python>`: When you need to analyze a Python program, you can make use of the large collection of classes in the CodeQL library for Python.

-  :doc:`Analyzing data flow in Python <analyzing-data-flow-in-python>`: You can use CodeQL to track the flow of data through a Python program to places where the data is used.

-  :doc:`Using API graphs in Python <using-api-graphs-in-python>`: API graphs are a uniform interface for referring to functions, classes, and methods defined in external libraries.

-  :doc:`Functions in Python <functions-in-python>`: You can use syntactic classes from the standard CodeQL library to find Python functions and identify calls to them.

-  :doc:`Expressions and statements in Python <expressions-and-statements-in-python>`: You can use syntactic classes from the CodeQL library to explore how Python expressions and statements are used in a codebase.

-  :doc:`Analyzing control flow in Python <analyzing-control-flow-in-python>`: You can write CodeQL queries to explore the control-flow graph of a Python program, for example, to discover unreachable code or mutually exclusive blocks of code.
