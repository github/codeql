* README
This workshop takes a slighly different approach for comprehensivenes and
packaging.

The content in [[./workshop.html]] contains all steps needed in setting up a query for
a project, including installing the project itself, building the ql database, and
running the project and identifying the error.
Because the focus is on codeql, these steps are in appendices referenced as
needed.

For packaging, the =make-zipfile= script is set up to package the =workshop.html=
file along with intermediate queries in one directory, and to put the pre-built ql
database into a parallel directory within a single zip file.  For learners, this
means extracting one zip file and getting a complete setup for query writing.

Another idea that has come up is to include a third directory with the =ql/=
library used for the project, to avoid ql setup issues and potential version
problems.
