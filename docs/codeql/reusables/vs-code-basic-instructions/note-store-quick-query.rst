   Note

   If you want to move your experimental query somewhere more permanent, you need to move the whole ``Quick Queries`` directory. The directory is a CodeQL pack with a ``qlpack.yml`` file that defines the content as queries for |language-text| CodeQL databases. For more information about CodeQL packs, see ":ref:`Working with CodeQL packs in Visual Studio Code <working-with-codeql-packs-in-visual-studio-code>`."
