   Note

   If you want to move your experimental query somewhere more permanent, you need to move the whole ``Quick Queries`` directory. The directory is a CodeQL pack with a ``qlpack.yml`` file that defines the content as queries for |language-text| CodeQL databases. For more information about CodeQL packs, see "`Managing CodeQL query packs and library packs <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-for-vs-code-extension/managing-codeql-packs/>`__."
