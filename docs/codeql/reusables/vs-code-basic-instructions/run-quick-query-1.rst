The CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code adds several **CodeQL:** commands to the command palette including **Quick Query**, which you can use to run a query without any set up.

#. From the command palette in Visual Studio Code, select **CodeQL: Quick Query**.

#. After a moment, a new tab *quick-query.ql* is opened, ready for you to write a query for your currently selected CodeQL database (here a |language-code| database). If you are prompted to reload your workspace as a multi-folder workspace to allow Quick queries, accept or create a new workspace using the starter workflow.
