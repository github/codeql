   Note

   You can use the CodeQL template (beta) in `GitHub Codespaces <https://github.com/codespaces/new?template_repository=github/codespaces-codeql>`__ to try out the QL concepts and programming-language-agnostic examples in these tutorials. The template includes a guided introduction to working with QL, and makes it easy to get started.
   
   When you're ready to run CodeQL queries on actual codebases, you will need to install the CodeQL extension in Visual Studio Code. For instructions, see ":ref:`Setting up CodeQL in Visual Studio Code <setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code>`."
