    .. [1] C++20 support is currently in beta. Supported for GCC on Linux only. Modules are *not* supported.
    .. [2] Support for the clang-cl compiler is preliminary.
    .. [3] Support for the Arm Compiler (armcc) is preliminary.
    .. [4] Builds that execute on Java 7 to 20 can be analyzed. The analysis understands Java 20 standard language features.
    .. [5] ECJ is supported when the build invokes it via the Maven Compiler plugin or the Takari Lifecycle plugin.
    .. [6] Kotlin support is currently in beta.
    .. [7] JSX and Flow code, YAML, JSON, HTML, and XML files may also be analyzed with JavaScript files.
    .. [8] The extractor requires Python 3 to run. To analyze Python 2.7 you should install both versions of Python.
    .. [9] Requires glibc 2.17.
    .. [10] TypeScript analysis is performed by running the JavaScript extractor with TypeScript enabled. This is the default.
