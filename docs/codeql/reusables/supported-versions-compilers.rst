    .. [1] C++20 modules are *not* supported.
    .. [2] C23 and C++23 support is currently in beta.
    .. [3] Objective-C, Objective-C++, C++/CLI, and C++/CX are not supported.
    .. [4] Support for the clang-cl compiler is preliminary.
    .. [5] Support for the Arm Compiler (armcc) is preliminary.
    .. [6] Builds that execute on Java 7 to 24 can be analyzed. The analysis understands standard language features in Java 8 to 24; "preview" and "incubator" features are not supported. Source code using Java language versions older than Java 8 are analyzed as Java 8 code.
    .. [7] ECJ is supported when the build invokes it via the Maven Compiler plugin or the Takari Lifecycle plugin.
    .. [8] JSX and Flow code, YAML, JSON, HTML, and XML files may also be analyzed with JavaScript files.
    .. [9] The extractor requires Python 3 to run. To analyze Python 2.7 you should install both versions of Python.
    .. [10] Requires glibc 2.17.
    .. [11] Requires ``rustup`` and ``cargo`` to be installed. Features from nightly toolchains are not supported.
    .. [12] Support for the analysis of Swift requires macOS.
    .. [13] TypeScript analysis is performed by running the JavaScript extractor with TypeScript enabled. This is the default.
