    # Since the Immutable Actions feature is not yet available to customers, we won't alert about
    # any unversioned immutable action references for now. Within GitHub, we'll include the
    # `codeql/immutable-actions-list` model pack, which will provide the necessary list of actions
    # for internal use. Once the feature is available to customers, we'll move that list back into
    # this file.
