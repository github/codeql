* The `actions/unversioned-immutable-action` query will no longer report any alerts, since the
  Immutable Actions feature is not yet available for customer use. The query remains in the
  default Code Scanning suites for use internal to GitHub. Once the Immutable Actions feature is
  available, the query will be updated to report alerts again.
