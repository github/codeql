# When changing/updating these, the `cargo-bazel-lock.json` file has to be regenerated.
# Run `CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=true CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN_ONLY=ruby_deps ./build --bazel sync --only=ruby_deps`
# in the `semmle-code` repository to do so.
# For more information, check out the documentation at
# https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html#repinning--updating-dependencies
# In the future, the hope is to move this handling of the dependencies entirely into the `codeql` repository,
# but that depends on `rules_rust` being fully compatible with bzlmod, which they aren't yet
# (c.f. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/2452).
# Warning: The process takes >5min on my M1 mac, so do wait for a while.

# Ideally, we'd like to pull this in via a relative path.
# However, our bazel/rust tooling chokes on this, c.f. https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/1525
# Therefore, to break that dependency, we depend on it via a git dependency instead.
# We should change this back to a path dependency once this issue is fixed.
# We can't depend on this without a rev/branch specification, as the rules_rust code assumes the default branch
# is called `master`, and if we pull this in with `branch=main`, then `cargo` works (and pins this at th current git SHA
# of lock-file update time, but `rules_rust` pins generates a bazel rule that unconditionally downloads `main`, which
# breaks build hermeticity. So, rev-pinning it is.
# See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/2502.
