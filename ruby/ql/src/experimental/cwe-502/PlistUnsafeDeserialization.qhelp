            Processing an unvalidated user input can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in your application.
            Unsafe deserializing the malicious serialized xml document through the Plist library, making it possible to execute some code or execute arbitrary code with the help of a complete gadget chain.
        </p>
    </overview>
    <recommendation>
        <p>
        This vulnerability in Plist can be prevented by calling <code>Plist.parse_xml FileOrXmlString, marshal: false</code>.
        </p>
    </recommendation>
    <example>
        <p>In the example below, you can see safe and unsafe Plist dangerous method calls that can be abused by a remote user input. You can use "marshal: false" as an arugument for <code>Plist.parse_xml</code> to use it safe.
