## Overview
In Ruby, it is not necessary to explicitly initialize variables.
If a local variable has not been explicitly initialized, it will have the value `nil`. If this happens unintentionally, though, the variable will not represent an object with the expected methods, and a method call on the variable will raise a `NoMethodError`.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the variable cannot be `nil` at the point highlighted by the alert.
This can be achieved by using a safe navigation or adding a check for `nil`.

Note: You do not need to explicitly initialize the variable, if you can make the program deal with the possible `nil` value. In particular, initializing the variable to `nil` will have no effect, as this is already the value of the variable. If `nil` is the only possible default value, you need to handle the `nil` value instead of initializing the variable.

## Example

### Incorrect Usage

In the following code, the call to `create_file` may fail and then the call `f.close` will raise a `NoMethodError` since `f` will be `nil` at that point.

```ruby
def dump(x)
  f = create_file
  f.puts(x)
ensure
  f.close
end
```

### Correct Usage

We can fix this by using safe navigation:
```ruby
def dump(x)
  f = create_file
  f.puts(x)
ensure
  f&.close
end
```
