<overview>
<p>
Directly evaluating user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) as code without first
sanitizing the input allows an attacker arbitrary code execution. This can occur when user
input is passed to code that interprets it as an expression to be
evaluated, using methods such as <code>Kernel.eval</code> or <code>Kernel.send</code>.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Avoid including user input in any expression that may be dynamically evaluated. If user input must
be included, use context-specific escaping before including it.
It is important that the correct escaping is used for the type of evaluation that will occur.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>
The following example shows two functions setting a name from a request.
The first function uses <code>eval</code> to execute the <code>set_name</code> method.
This is dangerous as it can allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the server.
For example, the user could supply the value <code>"' + exec('rm -rf') + '"</code>
to destroy the server's file system.
The second function calls the <code>set_name</code> method directly and is thus safe.
