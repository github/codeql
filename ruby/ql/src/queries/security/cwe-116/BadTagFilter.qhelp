<overview>
<p>
It is possible to match some single HTML tags using regular expressions (parsing general HTML using 
regular expressions is impossible). However, if the regular expression is not written well it might 
be possible to circumvent it, which can lead to cross-site scripting or other security issues.
</p>
<p>
Some of these mistakes are caused by browsers having very forgiving HTML parsers, and
will often render invalid HTML containing syntax errors. 
Regular expressions that attempt to match HTML should also recognize tags containing such syntax errors.
</p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
Use a well-tested sanitization or parser library if at all possible. These libraries are much more
likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>
The following example attempts to filters out all <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.
</p>

<sample src="examples/BadTagFilter.rb" />

<p>
The above sanitizer does not filter out all <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. 
Browsers will not only accept <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> as script end tags, but also tags such as <code>&lt;/script foo="bar"&gt;</code> even though it is a parser error.
This means that an attack string such as <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script foo="bar"&gt;</code> will not be filtered by 
the function, and <code>alert(1)</code> will be executed by a browser if the string is rendered as HTML.
</p>

<p>
Other corner cases include that HTML comments can end with <code>--!&gt;</code>, 
and that HTML tag names can contain upper case characters.
