## 1.2.0

### Major Analysis Improvements

* The query `rb/useless-assignment-to-local` now comes with query help and has been tweaked to produce fewer false positives.
* The query `rb/uninitialized-local-variable` now only produces alerts when the variable is the receiver of a method call and should produce very few false positives. It also now comes with a help file.
