## 0.5.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/stack-trace-exposure`, to detect exposure of stack-traces to users via HTTP responses.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `AlertSuppression.ql` query has been updated to support the new `# codeql[query-id]` supression comments. These comments can be used to suppress an alert and must be placed on a blank line before the alert. In addition the legacy `# lgtm` and `# lgtm[query-id]` comments can now also be placed on the line before an alert.
* Extended the `rb/kernel-open` query with following sinks: `IO.write`, `IO.binread`, `IO.binwrite`, `IO.foreach`, `IO.readlines`, and `URI.open`.
