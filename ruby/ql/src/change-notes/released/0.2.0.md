## 0.2.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/improper-memoization`. The query finds cases where the parameter of a memoization method is not used in the memoization key.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm" (`rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`) now reports if a cryptographic operation is potentially insecure due to use of a weak block mode.
