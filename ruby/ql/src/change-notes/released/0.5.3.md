## 0.5.3

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/regex/badly-anchored-regexp`, to detect regular expression validators that use `^` and `$` 
  as anchors and therefore might match only a single line of a multi-line string.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `rb/polynomial-redos` query now considers the entrypoints of the API of a gem as sources.
