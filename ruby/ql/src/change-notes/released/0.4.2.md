## 0.4.2

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/non-constant-kernel-open`, to detect uses of Kernel.open and related methods with non-constant values.
* Added a new query, `rb/sensitive-get-query`, to detect cases where sensitive data is read from the query parameters of an HTTP `GET` request.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* HTTP response header and body writes via `ActionDispatch::Response` are now
  recognized.
* The `rb/path-injection` query now treats the `file:` argument of the Rails `render` method as a sink.
* The alert messages of many queries were changed to better follow the style guide and make the messages consistent with other languages.
