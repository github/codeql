## 0.7.0

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a bug in how `map_filter` calls are analyzed. Previously, such calls would
  appear to the return the receiver of the call, but now the return value of the callback
  is properly taken into account.

### Bug Fixes

* The experimental query "Arbitrary file write during zipfile/tarfile extraction" (`ruby/zipslip`) has been renamed to "Arbitrary file access during archive extraction ("Zip Slip")."
