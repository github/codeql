## 0.0.12

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`. The query finds cases where sensitive information, such as user credentials, are stored as cleartext.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-hostname-regexp`. The query finds instances where a hostname is incompletely sanitized due to an unescaped character in a regular expression.
