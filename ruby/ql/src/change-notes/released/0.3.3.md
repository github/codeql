## 0.3.3

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/log-injection`, to detect cases where a malicious user may be able to forge log entries.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`. The query
  finds string transformations that do not replace all occurrences of a
  multi-character substring.
* Added a new query, `rb/suspicious-regexp-range`, to detect character ranges in regular expressions that seem to match 
  too many characters.
