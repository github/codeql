## 0.4.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/hardcoded-data-interpreted-as-code`, to detect cases where hardcoded data is executed as code, a technique associated with backdoors.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `rb/unsafe-deserialization` query now includes alerts for user-controlled data passed to `Hash.from_trusted_xml`, since that method can deserialize YAML embedded in the XML, which in turn can result in deserialization of arbitrary objects.
* The alert message of many queries have been changed to make the message consistent with other languages.
