## 0.5.5

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/zip-slip`, to detect arbitrary file writes during extraction of zip/tar archives.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* `rb/sensitive-get-query` no longer reports flow paths from input parameters to sensitive use nodes. This avoids cases where many flow paths could be generated for a single parameter, which caused excessive paths to be generated.
