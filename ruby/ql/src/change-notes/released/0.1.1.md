## 0.1.1

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/insecure-download`. The query finds cases where executables and other sensitive files are downloaded over an insecure connection, which may allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Added a new query, `rb/regex/missing-regexp-anchor`, which finds regular expressions which are improperly anchored. Validations using such expressions are at risk of being bypassed.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-sanitization`. The query finds string transformations that do not replace or escape all occurrences of a meta-character.
