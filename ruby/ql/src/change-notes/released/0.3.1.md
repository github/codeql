## 0.3.1

### New Queries

* Added a new experimental query, `rb/manually-checking-http-verb`, to detect cases when the HTTP verb for an incoming request is checked and then used as part of control flow.
* Added a new experimental query, `rb/weak-params`, to detect cases when the rails strong parameters pattern isn't followed and values flow into persistent store writes.
