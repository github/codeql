## 0.0.8

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/weak-cookie-configuration`. The query finds cases where cookie configuration options are set to values that may make an application more vulnerable to certain attacks.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `rb/csrf-protection-disabled` has been extended to find calls to the Rails method `protect_from_forgery` that may weaken CSRF protection.
