### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Fixed a bug that would occur when an `initialize` method returns `self` or one of its parameters.
  In such cases, the corresponding calls to `new` would be associated with an incorrect return type.
  This could result in inaccurate call target resolution and cause false positive alerts.
* Fixed an issue where calls to `delete` or `assoc` with a constant-valued argument would be analyzed imprecisely,
  as if the argument value was not a known constant.
