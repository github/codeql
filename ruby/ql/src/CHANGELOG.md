### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/insecure-download`. The query finds cases where executables and other sensitive files are downloaded over an insecure connection, which may allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Added a new query, `rb/regex/missing-regexp-anchor`, which finds regular expressions which are improperly anchored. Validations using such expressions are at risk of being bypassed.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-sanitization`. The query finds string transformations that do not replace or escape all occurrences of a meta-character.

* Added a new query, `rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`. The query finds uses of cryptographic algorithms that are known to be weak, such as DES.
* Added a new query, `rb/http-tainted-format-string`. The query finds cases where data from remote user input is used in a string formatting method in a way that allows arbitrary format specifiers to be inserted.
* Added a new query, `rb/http-to-file-access`. The query finds cases where data from remote user input is written to a file.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`. The query finds instances where a URL is incompletely sanitized due to insufficient checks.
