## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

### New Queries

* Added a new experimental query, `rb/manually-checking-http-verb`, to detect cases when the HTTP verb for an incoming request is checked and then used as part of control flow.
* Added a new experimental query, `rb/weak-params`, to detect cases when the rails strong parameters pattern isn't followed and values flow into persistent store writes.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

* Contextual queries and the query libraries they depend on have been moved to the `codeql/ruby-all` package.

## 0.2.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/improper-memoization`. The query finds cases where the parameter of a memoization method is not used in the memoization key.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm" (`rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`) now reports if a cryptographic operation is potentially insecure due to use of a weak block mode.

## 0.1.1

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/insecure-download`. The query finds cases where executables and other sensitive files are downloaded over an insecure connection, which may allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Added a new query, `rb/regex/missing-regexp-anchor`, which finds regular expressions which are improperly anchored. Validations using such expressions are at risk of being bypassed.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-sanitization`. The query finds string transformations that do not replace or escape all occurrences of a meta-character.

## 0.1.0

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/insecure-dependency`. The query finds cases where Ruby gems may be downloaded over an insecure communication channel.
* Added a new query, `rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm`. The query finds uses of cryptographic algorithms that are known to be weak, such as DES.
* Added a new query, `rb/http-tainted-format-string`. The query finds cases where data from remote user input is used in a string formatting method in a way that allows arbitrary format specifiers to be inserted.
* Added a new query, `rb/http-to-file-access`. The query finds cases where data from remote user input is written to a file.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`. The query finds instances where a URL is incompletely sanitized due to insufficient checks.

## 0.0.13

## 0.0.12

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`. The query finds cases where sensitive information, such as user credentials, are stored as cleartext.
* Added a new query, `rb/incomplete-hostname-regexp`. The query finds instances where a hostname is incompletely sanitized due to an unescaped character in a regular expression.

## 0.0.11

## 0.0.10

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`. The query finds cases where sensitive information, such as user credentials, are logged as cleartext.

## 0.0.9

## 0.0.8

### New Queries

* Added a new query, `rb/weak-cookie-configuration`. The query finds cases where cookie configuration options are set to values that may make an application more vulnerable to certain attacks.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The query `rb/csrf-protection-disabled` has been extended to find calls to the Rails method `protect_from_forgery` that may weaken CSRF protection.

## 0.0.7

## 0.0.6

## 0.0.5

## 0.0.4

### New Queries

* A new query (`rb/request-forgery`) has been added. The query finds HTTP requests made with user-controlled URLs.
* A new query (`rb/csrf-protection-disabled`) has been added. The query finds cases where cross-site forgery protection is explictly disabled.

### Query Metadata Changes

* The precision of "Hard-coded credentials" (`rb/hardcoded-credentials`) has been decreased from "high" to "medium". This query will no longer be run and displayed by default on Code Scanning and LGTM.
