   * this node in the API graph" without negative recursion is tricky.
   *
   * So instead most nodes are directly associated with a data-flow node, representing
   * either a use or a definition of an API component. This ensures that we only have a finite
   * number of nodes. However, we can now have multiple nodes with the same access
   * path, which are essentially indistinguishable for a client of the API.
   *
   * On the other hand, a single node can have multiple access paths (which is, of
   * course, unavoidable). We pick as canonical the alphabetically least access path with
