## 0.0.11

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The `Regex` class is now an abstract class that extends `StringlikeLiteral` with implementations for `RegExpLiteral` and string literals that 'flow' into functions that are known to interpret string arguments as regular expressions such as `Regex.new` and `String.match`.
* The regular expression parser now groups sequences of normal characters. This reduces the number of instances of `RegExpNormalChar`.
