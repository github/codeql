## 0.8.10

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Calls to `I18n.translate` as well as Rails helper translate methods now propagate taint from their keyword arguments. The Rails translate methods are also recognized as XSS sanitizers when using keys marked as html safe.
* Calls to `Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral.new` are now modeled as instances of the `SqlConstruction` concept, as well as propagating taint from their argument.
* Additional arguments beyond the first of calls to the  `ActiveRecord` methods `select`, `reselect`, `order`, `reorder`, `joins`, `group`, and `pluck` are now recognized as sql injection sinks. 
* Calls to several methods of `ActiveRecord::Connection`, such as `ActiveRecord::Connection#exec_query`, are now recognized as SQL executions, including those via subclasses.
