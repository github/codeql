## 0.3.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Calls to methods generated by ActiveRecord associations are now recognised as
  instantiations of ActiveRecord objects. This increases the sensitivity of
  queries such as `rb/sql-injection` and `rb/stored-xss`.
* Calls to `ActiveRecord::Base.create` and `ActiveRecord::Base.update` are now
  recognised as write accesses.
* Arguments to `Mime::Type#match?` and `Mime::Type#=~` are now recognised as
  regular expression sources.
