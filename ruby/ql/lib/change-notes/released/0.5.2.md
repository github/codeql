## 0.5.2

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Data flowing from the `locals` argument of a Rails `render` call is now tracked to uses of that data in an associated view.
* Access to headers stored in the `env` of Rack requests is now recognized as a source of remote input.
* Ruby 3.2: anonymous rest and keyword rest arguments can now be passed as arguments, instead of just used in method parameters.
