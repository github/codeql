## 1.0.3

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Element references with blocks, such as `foo[:bar] { |x| puts x}`, are now parsed correctly.
* The `CleartextSources.qll` library, used by `rb/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` and `rb/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`, has been updated to consider heuristics for additional categories of sensitive data.
