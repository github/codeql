## 0.4.0

### Breaking Changes

* `import ruby` no longer brings the standard Ruby AST library into scope; it instead brings a module `Ast` into scope, which must be imported. Alternatively, it is also possible to import `codeql.ruby.AST`.
* Changed the `HTTP::Client::Request` concept from using `MethodCall` as base class, to using `DataFlow::Node` as base class. Any class that extends `HTTP::Client::Request::Range` must be changed, but if you only use the member predicates of `HTTP::Client::Request`, no changes are required.

### Deprecated APIs

* Some classes/modules with upper-case acronyms in their name have been renamed to follow our style-guide. 
  The old name still exists as a deprecated alias.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Uses of `ActionView::FileSystemResolver` are now recognized as filesystem accesses.
* Accesses of ActiveResource models are now recognized as HTTP requests.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue in the taint tracking analysis where implicit reads were not allowed by default in sinks or additional taint steps that used flow states.
