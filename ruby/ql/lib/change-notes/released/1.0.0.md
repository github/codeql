## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* CodeQL package management is now generally available, and all GitHub-produced CodeQL packages have had their version numbers increased to 1.0.0.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Additional heuristics for a new sensitive data classification for private information (e.g. credit card numbers) have been added to the shared `SensitiveDataHeuristics.qll` library. This may result in additional results for queries that use sensitive data such as `rb/sensitive-get-query`.
