## 0.8.6

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Parsing of division operators (`/`) at the end of a line has been improved. Before they were wrongly interpreted as the start of a regular expression literal (`/.../`) leading to syntax errors.
* Parsing of `case` statements that are formatted with the value expression on a different line than the `case` keyword  has been improved and should no longer lead to syntax errors.
* Ruby now makes use of the shared type tracking library, exposed as `codeql.ruby.typetracking.TypeTracking`. The existing type tracking library, `codeql.ruby.typetracking.TypeTracker`, has consequently been deprecated.
