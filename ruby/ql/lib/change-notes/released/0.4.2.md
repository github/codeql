### Minor Analysis Improvements

* The hashing algorithms from `Digest` and `OpenSSL::Digest` are now recognized and can be flagged by the `rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm` query.
* More sources of remote input arising from methods on `ActionDispatch::Request` are now recognized.
* The response value returned by the `Faraday#run_request` method is now also considered a source of remote input.
* `ActiveJob::Serializers.deserialize` is considered to be a code execution sink.
* Calls to `params` in `ActionMailer` classes are now treated as sources of remote user input.
* Taint flow through `ActionController::Parameters` is tracked more accurately.
