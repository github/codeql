## 0.3.4

### Deprecated APIs

* The utility files previously in the `codeql.ruby.security.performance` package have been moved to the `codeql.ruby.security.regexp` package.  
  The previous files still exist as deprecated aliases.

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Most deprecated predicates/classes/modules that have been deprecated for over a year have been deleted.
* Calls to `render` in Rails controllers and views are now recognized as HTTP
  response bodies.
