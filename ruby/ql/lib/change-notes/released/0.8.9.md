## 0.8.9

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Raw output ERB tags of the form `<%== ... %>` are now recognised as cross-site scripting sinks.
* The name "certification" is no longer seen as possibly being a certificate, and will therefore no longer be flagged in queries like "clear-text-logging" which look for sensitive data.
